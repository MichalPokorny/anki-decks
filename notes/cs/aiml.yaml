-       guid: eW::=h+Mxb
        front: F-1 score
        back: 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall). AKA F-measure.
-       guid: BJws6dCbFz
        front: Generative vs. discriminative models
        back: Discriminative model learns conditional probability distribution [$]p(y|x)[/$].
                Generative model learns joint probability distribution [$]p(x,y)[/$].
