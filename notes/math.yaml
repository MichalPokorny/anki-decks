                        Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula. Computes n-th binary digit of pi using base 16 math.
                        Can directly calculate some digit of pi without calculating preceding digits.
                        Since this discovery, many formulas for other irrational constants have been discovered of the general form.
                        Formulas in this form are known as BBP-type formulas.

                        \pi = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}\left[ \frac{1}{16^k} \left( \frac{4}{8k + 1} - \frac{2}{8k + 4} - \frac{1}{8k + 5} - \frac{1}{8k + 6} \right) \right]

                front: Goodstein theorem
                back: Goodstein theorem is a statement about natural numbers which states that every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at 0. Unprovable in Peano arithmetic, but can be proven in stronger systems, e.g. second order arithmetic.
