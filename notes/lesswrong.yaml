                        Ignoring acausal blackmail - the basilisk is about the use of negative incentives to influence my actions.
                        If I refuse these incentives, then it's not instrumentally useful to apply them in the first place.
                        Engage in all positive acausal trades and ignore all attempts at acausal blackmail.
                        Act as if you are already being simulated, and ignore the possibility of a negative incentive.

                        Decision theories are not binding. I can decide not to use whichever decision theory and tell
                        Omega to fuck off and anyone simulating you will come to the same conclusion, making it not
                        instrumentally useful to blackmail you.
