                *Ignoring acausal blackmail* - basilisk is about the
                use of negative incentives to influence my actions.
                If I refuse these, then it's not instrumentally useful
                to apply them in the first place.
                Engage in all positive acausal trades and ignore all
                attempts at acausal blackmail.
                Act as if you are already being simulated, ignore
                the possibility of a negative incentive.

                *Decision theories are not binding*. I can decide not
                to use whichever decision theory and tell
                Omega to fuck off and anyone simulating you will come
                to the same conclusion, making it not
                instrumentally useful to blackmail you.
