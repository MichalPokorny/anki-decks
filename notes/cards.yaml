                front: Robert Cialdini's 6 principles of persuasion applied to EA
                back:
                        Reciprocation - people feel indebted to those who do something for them or give them a gift.<br>

                        Social proof - when people are uncertain about a decision, they look to those around them for guidance.<br>

                        Commitment and consistency - people don't like to back out of commitments; they follow pre-existing attitudes, values, actions.
                                -- ask "will you consider taking the pledge"; praise people for making good past decisions ("You've always been a charitable person.")<br>

                        Liking - people are more likely to say yes to people they know and like.<br>

                        Authority - impressive clothing, etc. (Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckenberg; EA started by academics at Oxford)<br>

                        Scarcity - people are more likely to want something they perceive as scarce (GiveWell recommends just 4 or 5)

                back: Free will is compatible with determinism. You are free as long as you have no inner/outer compulsions that would prevent you from acting on actual desires and intentions. (We don't have to be the *conscious source* of our thoughts to be free.)
