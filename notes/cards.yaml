                front: Paradox of hedonism
                back: AKA pleasure paradox. Pleasure cannot be acquired directly. Constant pleasure-seeking may not yield the most actual pleasure or happiness in the long run - consciously pursuing pleasure interferes with experiencing it.

                back:
                        AKA agency dilemma. Occurs when one person/entity ("agent") is
                        able to make decisions on behalf of "principal". Exists when
                        agent is motivated to act in his own interests, which are
                        contrary to those of the principal. Example of moral hazard.
