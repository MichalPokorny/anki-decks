        back: |
                AKA pleasure paradox. Pleasure cannot be acquired
                directly. Constant pleasure-seeking may not yield
                most actual long-term pleasure/happiness - consciously
                pursuing pleasure interferes with experiencing it.

                *Commitment and consistency* - you don't like to
                back out of commitments; follow pre-existing
                attitudes, values, actions.
                &mdash; ask "will you consider taking the pledge";
                praise past good decisions ("You've always been

                bushes from which it originated. Six of these
