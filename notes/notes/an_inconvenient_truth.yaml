                front: Why do CO2 concentrations go down in the summer and up in the winter?
                back:
                        Majority of Earth's vegetation (and land) is in the northern hemisphere,
                        which is tilted toward the Sun in the spring and summer; leaves come out and
                        ingest CO2. Leaves falling in autumn and spring release CO2 back.

                front: Why is New York cooler than Madrid?
                back: Europe is heated by Gulf Stream.  Warm water goes east from NY to Spain, then north, then cools and goes south-west towards South America.
