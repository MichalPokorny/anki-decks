        front: Two-horse betting without known probabilities - setting? How to bet
                optimally?
        back: "We pay [$]y_1[/$], if horse 1 wins, we get back [$]u_1 y_1[/$], otherwise\
                \ nothing.\nOptimal bet for fixed [$]Y=y_1+y_2[/$] is [$]y_1^\\* u_1\
                \ = y_2^\\* u_2[/$]"

        front: Multi-horse betting - setting? What's the optimal betting allocation?
                When does an optimal betting allocation yield a guaranteed profit?
        back: "We pay [$]y_1[/$], if horse 1 wins, we get back [$]u_1 y_1[/$], otherwise\
                \ nothing.\nOptimal bet for fixed [$]Y=y_1+y_2+\\ldots[/$] is [$]y_1^{\
                \ * } u_1 = y_2^{ * } u_2 = \\ldots[/$]\nI can get a guaranteed profit\
                \ if [$]\\frac{1}{\\sum_i u_i^{-1}} > 1[/$]. If it's equal, I break\
                \ even. Else, I lose."
-       guid: 'K]y:=y%yo:'
        front: Multi-horse betting - say I have 2 ideal bookmarkers (who I can't individually
                profit from) and they set a different multiplier for some horse. How
                can I turn a profit from that?
        back: |
                Because they're optimal, for both of them:
                [$]\frac{1}{\sum_i a_i^{-1}} = 1[/$],
                [$]\frac{1}{\sum_i b_i^{-1}} = 1[/$].
                Grab the one odd that differs and use it to make a profit.
-       guid: GpEkumsYc?
        front: Multi-horse betting - how do I maximize expected profit if I know probabilities?
        back: "Say payout multipliers are [$]u_i[/$]. Pick the horse where [$]u_i\
                \ p_i[/$] is the greatest. I will expect to profit if it's [$]>1[/$].\n\
                Or, if [$]q_j = 1/u_j[/$], pick maximum [$]p_j/q_j[/$]."
