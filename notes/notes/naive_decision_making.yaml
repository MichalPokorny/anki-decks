                front: Two-horse betting without known probabilities - setting? How to bet optimally?
                back:
                        We pay [$]y_1[/$], if horse 1 wins, we get back [$]u_1 y_1[/$], otherwise nothing.

                        Optimal bet for fixed [$]Y=y_1+y_2[/$] is [$]y_1^\* u_1 = y_2^\* u_2[/$]

                front: Multi-horse betting - setting? What's the optimal betting allocation? When does an optimal betting allocation yield a guaranteed profit?
                back:
                        We pay [$]y_1[/$], if horse 1 wins, we get back [$]u_1 y_1[/$], otherwise nothing.

                        Optimal bet for fixed [$]Y=y_1+y_2+\ldots[/$] is [$]y_1^{ * } u_1 = y_2^{ * } u_2 = \ldots[/$]

                        I can get a guaranteed profit if [$]\frac{1}{\sum_i u_i^{-1}} > 1[/$].
                        If it's equal, I break even. Else, I lose.

                front: Multi-horse betting - say I have 2 ideal bookmarkers (who I can't individually profit from) and they set a different multiplier for some horse. How can I turn a profit from that?
                back: >
                        Because they're optimal, for both of them:
                        [$]\frac{1}{\sum_i a_i^{-1}} = 1[/$],
                        [$]\frac{1}{\sum_i b_i^{-1}} = 1[/$].
                        Grab the one odd that differs and use it to make a profit.

                front: Multi-horse betting - how do I maximize expected profit if I know probabilities?
                back:
                        Say payout multipliers are [$]u_i[/$].
                        Pick the horse where [$]u_i p_i[/$] is the greatest.
                        I will expect to profit if it's [$]>1[/$].

                        Or, if [$]q_j = 1/u_j[/$], pick maximum [$]p_j/q_j[/$].
