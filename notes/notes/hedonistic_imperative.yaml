                front: Emotional encephalisation
                back: "Emotional encephalisation convinces its victims that happiness is inseparable from presence or absence of variously innervated types of intentional object. We are happy or sad 'about' things. Entirely non-coincidentally, the realisation of our most  emotionally  charged  types  of  intentional  object  tends  to  promote  the  inclusive fitness of our genes. Crudely, we like most what's good for them."
