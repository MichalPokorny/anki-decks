        front: Emotional encephalisation
        back: Emotional encephalisation convinces its victims that happiness is inseparable
                from presence or absence of variously innervated types of intentional
                object. We are happy or sad 'about' things. Entirely non-coincidentally,
                the realisation of our most  emotionally  charged  types  of  intentional  object  tends  to  promote  the  inclusive
                fitness of our genes. Crudely, we like most what's good for them.
