                Son of Harvard mathematician, trained in science from early
                age. Worked for a long time as a scientist for the US Coast
                and Geodetic Survey. Concerned with accurate measurement,
                contributed to theory of the pendulum. Attracted to logic
                and probability, closely studied Kant and Hegel.
                Contributed to expanding logic beyond Aristotelian syllogism
                (induction) - *inference to the best explanation*.

                4 ways to fix belief (in an individual, or community)
        back: |
                <ul>
                <li>
                <b>Tenacity:</b>
                repeat what we think, turn away from what might disturb it

                Nothing rational can be said against it, because these people
                don't care about rationality.

                Peirce doesn't object that it leaves us with false beliefs.
                Objection: It will be unable to hold its ground in practice,
                the social impulse is against it.
                It will occur to us that others have opinions with the same
                claims to validity as ours.
                <li>
                <b>Authority:</b>
                Create an institution that will keep correct doctrines and
                perpetuate them, and prevent contrary doctrines from being
                taught. Terrify anyone who would reject the established belief.

                It is superior, and for the mass of humankind, no better
                method may exist.

                It's also unstable: some people will see that other doctrines
                have been held in other times or places. (But - doesn't draw
                the conclusion that custom is king of all.)
                <li>
                <b>A priori method / method of natural preferences:</b>
                Accept what seems *obvious*, or maybe *clear and distinct*.
                Our opinions are those we arrive at through reflection,
                conversation, thought.

                Plato ... Hegel's metaphysical methods are examples.

                Still unsatisfactory: what's obvious for one is not obvious
                for another; pendulum between material and spiritual philosophy
                <li>
                <b>Method of science:</b>
                What we need: some method by which beliefs are determined
                by nothing human, but by something upon which our thinking
                has no effect - something eternal.
                The ultimate conclusion of every man must be the same.

                Fundamental hypothesis: there are Real things, whose characters
                are entirely independent of our opinions about them; those
                Reals affect our senses according to regular laws, and, through
                our sensations are as different as our relations to
                the objects, we can still ascertain by reasoning and perception
                how things really and truly are, and anyone with sufficient
                experience and reason will come to the same conclusions.

        front: Belief vs doubt
        back: |
                Belief and doubt are different sensations.

                We're strongly disposed to escape doubt, but we're content
                when we have a belief.

                Belief is a *habit*, doubt is the lack of such a habit.
                Belief is *not a momentary mode of consciousness*.
                It also doesn't make us act, but when a condition arises,
                we do something.
                Doubting is the lack of a settled habit, it is essentially
                anxious and irritating.

        front: 3 things essential to inquiry
        back: |
                <ul>
                <li>
                <b>Stimulus - doubt.</b>
                Inquiry always begins with a felt problem.
                (But - not the mere putting of propositions into interrogative
                form does not provide a stimulus. There must be a *real*,
                *living* doubt - vs Descartes)
                Descartes's doubt is just "make-believe". This "initial
                skepticism" is just self-deception, not real doubt - we still
                carry all our prejudices. Cartesian doubt actually leads to
                recovering the beliefs we held before!

                What we need is **NOT** an absolutely certain starting point,
                but a *method* of improving beliefs that, to begin with,
                we don't imagine *can* be doubted.
                <li>
                <b>End - settlement of opinion</b>

                Isn't this aiming too low? Shouldn't we want to get *truth*?
                <li>
                <b>Method - science</b>
                </ul>

        topic: Charles Sanders Peirce
        front: View on truth
        back: |
                Truth/falsity are definable in terms of doubt, belief,
                the course of experience. If you try to use them to refer
                to something external, you know nothing about these entities,
                Ockham's razor shaves them off.

                What motivates our doubt is the worry that they might not
                *correspond* with reality, but if that's what we mean, then
                we are taking of entities of whose existence we know nothing.

                We do not and cannot stabilize our beliefs by noticing
                that they are true (i.e., that they correspond to fact).

                There is also no *unmediated knowledge* - no theory-free
                apprehension of "the facts". We can never get a *pure
                conception* of a fact, uncontaminated by previous cognitions.

                Through everything we see is a phenomenal manifestation of
                ourselves, it also is a phenomenon of something without
                us - like a rainbow involves rain and the sun.

                Truth is *unassailable belief*, or belief we would tend to
                if belief were to tend to absolute fixity.
                It is defined *not by the individual, but by the community
                of inquirers*.

                Beliefs, being habits, invariably lead to conduct in
                conjunction with desires that move us to act.
                Belief "that is a hamburger" is true if I can eat it;
                it's false if biting it reveals rubber and does not satisfy
                my desire to eat.

        front: What is "the real"?
        back: |
                That whose characters are independent of what anybody may
                think them to be.
                (Not a perfectly correct definition, but a very helpful one.)

                Alternatively: Opinion that will be ultimately agreed on by all
                investigators. Object represented in truth is the real.

                Reality is independent - not necessarily of thought in general,
                only of what I or any finite number of men think about it.

                *Science* is the *criterion of the real* (the ideal science
                towards which scientific activity is moving).

                We *can* actually know things as they really are. There is no
                hidden *thing-in-itself*.

        back: |
                Pragmatism is not metaphysics, or attempt to determine truth
                of things. It's about finding meaning of hard words and
                abstract concepts.

                Meaning is restricted to *intellectual concepts*, opposed
                to *mere subjective feelings*.

        back: |

                Mere subjective feelings: inverted spectrum changes them.
                But inverted qualia don't change e.g. "hard".

                If you do not understand that a knife won't easily slice
                a hard object, then you don't understand what "hard" means.
                "Hard" is about the behavior of hard objects.

                Author: "The very first lesson that we have a right to demand
                that logic shall teach us is, how to make our ideas clear;
                and a most important one it is, depreciated only by minds who
                stand in need of it. To know what we think, to be masters of
                our own meaning, will make a solid foundation for great and
                weighty thought ... It is terrible to see how a single unclear
                idea, a single formula withou meaning, lurking in a young
                man's head, will sometimes act like an obstruction of inert
                matter in an artery, hindering the nutrition of the brain, and
                condemning its victim to pine away in the fullness of his
                intellectual vigor and in the midst of intellectual plenty."

                3. Consider what efects that might conceivable have practical
                bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have.
                Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our
                conception of the object.

                The word "hard" is a *sign*, its meaning is another *sign*.
                Meanings are not things, not brute facts, not sensations or
                actions.

                There is nothing in our conception of "hard" beyond the
                effects.

                All of these infinite number of tests, together, make up
                the concept of "hard".

                Author: "It will serve to show that almost every proposition
                of ontological metaphysics is either meaningless gibberish
                - one word being defined by other words, and they still by
                others, without any real conception ever being reached -
                or else is downright absurd; so that all such rubbish being
                swept away, what will remain of philosophy will be a series
                of problems capable of investigation by the observational

        back: |
                Both Hume and Peirce want to get rid of fakery and quakery
                in metaphysics. both think clarity of meaning will help.

                Hume: certifying the meaning of a term is *contemplative*,
                we find what perception led to the term.
                Peirce: to find out what a term means, we have to *do*
                something.

                Hume: criterion is *individualistic* and *private*.
                Peirce: public.

                Hume: investigation of meaning oriented to past,
                Peirce: to the future (future use).

                For Hume: meanings of words are *fixed* given past experience.
                Peirce: we are *creative* with respect to language.
                What we do determines their meaning. Language evolves.

        back: |
                *Truth* depends on us; what is true is what satisfies our
                needs. If evidence does not clearly decide the issue (i.e.,
                in many big philosophical questions), we are free to believe
                what makes us live a more satisfying life.

                e.g.: fatalism and predeterminism is not a belief that will
                make our lives better.
                Similar with faith in God: if it makes life more satisfying, go
                for it.

                1. He does not erect a barrier between knower and the known.
                We keep interacting with the world and are embedded in it;
                we don't just have access to our mental states.

                2. He also rejects the rule to "not frame hypotheses" -- mind
                does this on its own automatically.
                These leaps should be *encouraged*, not condemned.

                3. What is crucial is not whether a proposition is a leap
                beyond present evidence. What is crucial is that the theory
                *works* in the future.

                Pragmatism is the middle way, takes best from both

                Tradition is commited to particularism (in empiricism) and
                looks only back into the past, doesn't project into the future.
                Experience and thought have been antithetical in the past.

                1. The knower is not a disinterested spectator.

                2. We reject the notion of knowledge located exclusively in
                the subject (leaving the question of an objective world in
                the air)

                3. Experience is purposive; oriented toward the future (vs
                Hume, who traces ideas back to their original impressions;
                he only counts the *past*)

                4. Knowledge is ordinarily *full* of inference and in intimate
                contact with the objective world.

                Thus, the problem of the "reality of the external world" simply
                evaporates.
