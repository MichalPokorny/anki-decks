                Problem he found with philosophy
        back: |
                Seeking knowledge leads to more and more
                recognition of own ignorance. Math is nice.
                Nothing in philosophy hasn't been undoubted.

                What did he do when he couldn't find certainty?
        back: |
                Gave up "letters", didn't give up learning.
                He looked in the "great book of the world".

                Travelled, visited courts and armies, mixed with
                people of various temperaments and ranks,
                gathered experiences.

                2 influential "laws of nature" later adopted by Newton,
                departure from Aristotle
        back: |
                Each thing as far as in it lies, continues always
                in the same state. That which is moved always
                continues to move.

                All motion is of itself in a straight line.
                Things which move in circles tend to recede from
                the centre of the circle.

                Aristotle: all things tend to the center, and don't
                want to keep moving. This only makes sense in an
                infinite universe *with no center*.

                clearness inside. Ideas should not be possible
                to confuse with other ideas.
                <li> Divide each difficulty into as many parts
                as possible to resolve them better.
                <li> Direct thoughts orderly, beginning with simplest and most
                easily known objects to ascend little by little to complex
                knowledge.
                <li> Make complete and comprehensive enumerations and reviews
                so that nothing will be left out.

                Judgement is an activity of the mind.
                Implicit in all perception is judgement, *giving assent*.

                Example: piece of wax. Everything perceived about it can
                change, yet we judge it to be the same piece of wax.
                So, judgement is necessary.

                3 problems with Descartes's views

                <li> <i>Place of humans in nature</i>:
                        Are we cogs in a machine? Is there
                        room for purposes? Do we have free will?

                        Descartes's solution: radically split mind and
                        body.

                        We aren't automata (we have language),
                        we are more flexible and adaptable than any
                        machine.
                <li> <i>Mind-Body</i>.
                        Descartes: mind and body are separate,
                        yet we are a unity. How can we be at the same
                        time two and one?
                <li> <i>God and skepticism</i>.
                        If God deceives or doesn't exist,
                        it's a big problem.
