                Knowledge involves having the reason and cannot be overcome by
                rhetoric. Opinion is at mercy of persuasive speakers.

                Senses never get it right, aren't precise or accurate.

                <br><br>
                Truth cannot bounce around, truth we know cannot be about the
                world disclosed to senses. Nothing about it sits in place.
                <br><br>
                We can only know about objects apprehended by intellect.
                Whether we see a particular square as red or green,
                we agree its diagonal is [$]\\sqrt{2}\\cdot x[/$].

                Lower and Higher Forms
        back: |
                Lower forms are explained in terms of higher Forms.
                <br> <br>
                Every question of "why?" uses some factor higher
                on the Divided Line.
                Eagle shadows &rarr; actual eagles;
                eagles &rarr; Form Eagle;
                Form Eagle &rarr; more basic Forms.
                <br> <br>
                At the end of the explanation chains, there
                must be some basic point where we can't use this
                pattern of explanation any more &mdash; where we won't appeal
                to something more basic. But it must be intelligible
                in itself, and self-evident.

                they can be shared by many particulars.
                Plato: a complete explanation of the world must
                say
                why what happens is for the best; atomists say there
                is no purpose, goal or direction in the world.

        back: |
                Prisoners fettered in cave only see images of reality
                (Homer/Hesiod, or in our day, soaps, television news, ...).

                Who clims up the wall are like those who can look
                directly on things in the visible world.

                Fire casting the shadows represents the Sun.
                <br><br>
                Climbing out of the cave is the transition from things
                to Forms.
                <br><br>
                Sun there is the Form of the Good. At first,
                cannot be seen directly &mdash; only through lower
                forms illuminated by it, reflections of the Good.
                <br><br>
                Prisoner returning to cave and being killed
                and ridiculed is analogous to Socrates.
                <br><br>
                To love wisdom is to be motivated to leave the cave.
                The struggle is difficult and painful.

                Shepard in service of king of Lydia.
                <br><br>
                During storm, an earthquake broke ground open
                and created a chasm where he was tending his sheep.
                <br><br>
                Inside, he found (among others) a hollow bronze
                horse, and inside, a corpse wearing just a golden ring.
                <br><br>
                On a regular meeting with the king on state
                of flocks, he turned the ring in and out,
                and found that it makes him visible and invisible.
                <br><br>
                He arranged to become one of the messengers sent to
                the king, seduced his wife, attacked him
                with her help, killed him and took over the kingdom.

        front: Argument for just people being happy
        back: |
                Men are happy when their soul is in excellent shape &mdash;
                all 3 parts function properly.
                <br>
                The source of unhappiness is a lack of harmony in
                soul. Reason makes the decisions, supported by spirit,
                desire is channeled appropriately.
                <br><br>
                Justice happens when people are in harmony.
                Soul is happy when it is in harmony, hence "just".
                We have *social justice* and *internal personal justice*.
                Plato needs to show that *social justice* is good
                for the individual.
                *Internal justice*, it has been shown, is good for itself.
                <br>
                To be unjust is to allow the "internal beast" to rule
                and overwhelm "the man within".
                To be good is to be just,
                so the Form of Justice takes us to the Form of the Good.

        back: |
                As with Socrates, contrast between the many and the few.
                Plato is consciously and explicitly rejecting
                Athenian democracy. Not everyone is equally fit to govern.
                Where democracy rules, rhetoric and persuasion carry
                the day, not reason and wisdom.

        back: |
                Philosophers should rule as kings.
                Political power should coincide with philosophy.
                Philosopher-kings should love the sight of truth.

                Ship ruled by strong, stupid captain, who knows nothing about
                sea.
                <br><br>
                Sailors (also stupid) call ones who can persuade him to turn
                "navigators", or that they "know ships", but they don't know
                anything about the sky, the sea, etc. They say navigation is
                not teachable, and nothing can enable one to steer the ship
                better.
                <br><br>
                True captain would be called a babbler and good-for-nothing in
                ships governed that way.

                follow dialectical reasoning.

                There's one more form, which the Form of Man takes,
                as well as John and Peter. Infinite regress.
