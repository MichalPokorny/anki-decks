        front: Setting of the dialogue Euthyphro
        back: |
                Socrates is indicted to the king-archon's court
                for corrupting the youth. Meets Euthyphro, a priest.
                Euthyphro charges his own father.
                A servant of Euthyphro killed another servent in anger.
                Euthyphro's father bound the killer, and the cold and
                bonds caused his death before the message what should
                be done with him could be delivered.
                <br>
                They talk on piety - Socrates wants a definition
                so he can defend himself.

        front: Where did he tell the story of the oracle saying nobody's wiser than
                him?

        topic: Socrates
        front: Why is nobody wiser than him?
        back: |
                He tried to find someone wiser than him.
                People think they are wise, but are not.
                People, like poets, are good at one thing, and think
                they're wise at other most important pursuits.
                <br><br>
                "This man among you, mortals, is wisest who, like
                Socrates, understands that his wisdom is worthless."

        back: |
                He doesn't know if it isn't the biggest blessing of his
                life.
                It would be a great ignorance to believe that one knows
                what one doesn't know.

        topic: Socrates
        front: Apology - How should a man who really fights for justice live?
        back: |
                A private life, not a public one (like politics).
                <br>
                A good man would not survive in public life.

        front: Apology - Why didn't Socrates corrupt anybody?
        back: |
                Families of his followers were in the jury.
                All of them defended him.
                So they weren't corrupted or given bad advice.

                Difference: Wisdom of humans, gods
        back: |
                Gods know what makes is virtue and good life, we don't.
                <br>
                Best we can do: dialectical examination to remove false
                opinions, cure hubris of thinking we have wisdom appropriate
                to god.
                <br>
                Hence: The unexamined life is not worth living.
