                His literary technique and reason for using it
        back: |
                This technique is called "indirect communication".

                Most of us are in various degrees of self-deception and not
                honest with ourselves about categories that structure our
                lives.

                His characters are to identify with and then revealing what
                living that way means.

                Character - A
        back: |
                Just wants to *be something*. "You are the music while
                the music lasts." Wants complete absorption in
                pleasurable moments. Wants to evade reflection,
                self-consciousness, thought, choice, having
                to *become* something. Wants to enjoy *immediacy*
                (Hegel criticizes it as foundation for knowledge).

                Realizes it's not possible, immediacy doesn't exist
                if sought.

                A reflects on Don Juan. He is undifferentiated,
                unreflective desire. A: Sensuality is not human
                reality, but an aspect of it - an abstraction
                (Hegel's critique of immediacy, Epicureanism).

                He tries to make his life into a work of art, for
                aesthetic appreciation. He doesn't want it to be
                *boring* - that would be a terrible review of
                a movie.

                His basic evaluation of everything is a pair of
                concepts: *interesting/boring*.
                *Rotation of Crops*: how to keep things interesting.
                Recommends:
                <ul>
                <li> *Variety*. Varying surroundings and circumstances
                is "vulgar and unartistic". Instead, *vary yourself*.
                The key is remembering and forgetting artistically,
                not randomly.
                <li> *Beware entanglements, avoid commitments*.
                To have absolute freedom to break away from anything.
                No friendships (but many acquaintances), no marriage,
                no business.
                <li> *Stay in control*. Don't necessarily get what's
                best for you, but what you ask for.

                "The Seducer's Diary"

                Origin: levels of possibilities - accentuates "this is not you".

                Johaness, diarisst, fascinated by young Cordelia.

                Insinuates himself into her family, pays attention to her aunt,
                makes himself look interesting. Promotes Edward, conventional
                boring young man in love with Cordelia, as match for her.
                Slowly, brings Cordelia to see Edward as boring, compared to
                him. Manipulates engagement with himself, subtly influences her
                to think marriage impedes *true love*. *She* breaks the
                engagement. Passionate night together, then leaves her.

                Seducer is opposite of Don Juan - lives completely in
                reflection, only occasionally touches reality. Schemes, plots,
                etc. Enjoys building drama, keeps distance from everything,
                including himself. Claims to love Cordelia - in the esthetic
                sense, to be benefiting her - by *making her life more
                interesting* - will leave her a sophisticated woman. Taught her
                terrors of the possible.

                remedies
        back: |
                A is splintered into many semi-selves.

                Judge William: "mark" of romantic love is *immediacy*.
                Falling in love is something that *happens*.

                Lovers deeply convinced their relationship is something whole
                that can't be changed, which is false, since it's something
                that *just happens*.

                Cynism about love leads to (1) resigning on lasting love,
                serial affairs, (2) marriage of convenience without love.
                Judge William deplores both. A is right in valuing romance, but
                promise of eternity requires not "going with the flow", but
                choice - determination of will.

                *Conjugal love* - mark: engagement of will, making promises.
                Can provide continuity and permanence; not death of romantic
                love - it's its aid.

                Not fit for art, but married people have fought worse than
                dragons - time. Marriage is *aesthetic*.

                Ethical life requires development of the *self*.

        topic: Søren Kierkegaard
        front: Crucial difference between aesthetic and ethical
        back: |
                Choice. A's life is full of choice, but none of them
                are *significant* - he'snot commited.

                A's manner of saying "either/or" means loss of self.

                If we drift and fail to decisively take control of
                our life, we will lose our selves.

                When one chooses seriously, *engaging oneself*, one
                chooses *ethically*. Judge isn't urging A to choose *good* -
                just to *choose*.

                Judge's either/or is about categories of evaluation. We will
                live radically differently if we decide by "good/evil"
                (ethical) vs "interesting/boring" (esthetic).

                Do you choose with *ironic detachment*, or a *seriousness and
                passion of will*? Ethical person stops trying to *be*
                something, starts a project of *becoming* a self.

                Author: "Imagine a captain of a ship the moment a shift
                of direction must be made; then he may be able to say:
                I can do either this or that. But if he is not a

                this the ship is ploughing ahead with its ordinary
                velocity, and thus there is but a single moment when
                it is inconsequential whether he does this or does
                that. So also with a person ... there eventually comes
                a moment where it is no longer a matter of Either/Or,
                not because he has chosen, but because he has
                refrained from it, which also can be expressed
                by saying: Because others have chosen for him - or
                because he has lost himself."

                Etical: The task of the individual is to bring
                the two poles together.

                Unfortunately, the poles have a tendency to drift
                apart. We have a tendency to identify with just
                one, it's too anxiety-inducing to hold them together.
                We are not *willing to be ourselves* - we always
                want to approach God or be an unthinking brute.

                Recognizing this tension is beyond the ethical.
                We're trying to lift ourselves up by our bootstraps.

                and undermining ourselves in the ethical life,
                we can console ourselves, saying "I do what I can".
                This sets in a new anxiety. Calm it by deliberating
                on *the upbuilding that lies in the thought that
                in relation to God we are always in the wrong*.

                Is there anything beyond the ethical?

                Johannes meditates on the story of Abraham and Isaac.

                Johannes cannot understand or explain Abraham.
                Before Abraham, he is "silent"; Abraham does
                two contradictory things at once: a) gives up on
                him, takes him to Moriah; b) still clearly loves
                Isaac (he received Isaac with joy after not having
                to kill him).

                This absurdity is the secret life of faith.

                *Fear and Trembling* - the two knights
        back: |
                Knight of Infinite Resignation: Stoic, no claims,
                asks for nothing worldly, identifies with his
                infinite, reflective side.
                This movement is very hard.

                Knight of Faith: resigns everything, sets himself
                adrift, takes refuge in his eternal side, but as he's
                infinitely resignating, he comes back into the world.
                Johannes can't understand where he finds the strength.

                Faith is something to be lived. And it's not something
                particularly otherworldly or ascetic.

                Not easy to recognize a knight of faith. It's not about what
                they do or how, but why.

                Faith is hard. It's a passion.

                Faith cannot be learned in a formula from someone. To aspire to
                go beyond faith (like some Hegelians) is to not understand life
                of knights of faith.

        back: |
                When we are in two places at once: where we are, where we want
                to be. The further apart, the bigger the passion (fear,
                desperation, panic).

                Esthetic life has some passion, ethical has more (bigger
                distance between where he is and wants to be), Johaness
                *de silentio* says faith is highest passion.

                Biggest distance is between us as individuals who exist in
                time, and what is eternally true. Faith manifests as lifelong
                search.

                Presents option that we are continually deceiving ourselves,
                pretending to be other than we are, that we are further from
                truth than Socrates thinks. This distinguishes Christianity
                from paganistic religions.

                Christianity B says "we are sinners" - not just rule breakers.
                Sin is a condition of the self - despair. Despair is not
                willing to be oneself.

                Anti-Climacus ("super-christian" - Climacus is not a christian)
                writes *The Sickness unto Death* - exploring varieties
                of despair. Despair is our advantage over other animals, being
                in despair is the greatest misery.

                Despair is sickness in the self, leads to death of the self
                unless cured.

                Someone in despair despairs over *something* - so it
                seems *only for a moment*. In despairing over *something*,
                we really despair over *ourselves* and want to ***be
                rid of ourselves***.

                We are synthesis of what we (1) immediately, factually are,
                (2) the possibility of reflection and doing something about it.
                Being a self means, in addition, *relating these factors to
                each other*, bringing them into harmony.

                One can fail at being a self, that failure is despair:
                imbalance in the factors of synthesis that manifests in
                unwillingness to be ourselves.

                Infinitude's despair is finitude. Becoming fantastic. Loving
                all humanity, yet hating one's neighbor; etc.

                Finititude's despair lacks infinitude. Self without infinitude
                has no sharp edges, assumes only possibilities are "how things
                are done". This allows the self to be cheated of itself by
                "the others". Dares not to believe in oneself; gains all
                required for flawless performance in everyday life. Ground
                smooth as a pebble. Worldliness consists of people who pawn
                themselves to the world. Such people are perhaps mentioned in
                history, but are not themselves.

                Another form: being willing (in despair) to be oneself: despair
                of defiance. Don't want to don their own self, do not want to
                see their task in their given selves, but wants to construct it
                himself. The self wants to be its own god.

                Experimenting with self; nothing firm in this form.
                Self is not increasingly itself - it is increasingly obvious
                it's *hypothetically* itself. Self is its own master, and this
                is the despair, or can be regarded as its pleasure and joy.
                Yet this absolute ruler rules over nothing - self is subject to
                dialectic that rebellion is legitimate at any time.
                Despairing self builds castles on air.

                In relating to itself and in wanting to be itself, the self is

                Defiant self tries to establish itself, so it is unwilling to

                We must choose without knowing which is right or best. Moving
                from one kind of life to another is a *leap*, a conversion.

                There's no absolute vantage point from which to judge with
                absolute knowledge (as Hegel thought).

                A logical system is possible. An *existential* one is not.

                Geometry: OK. All theorems are implicit in the premises -
                such systems are "final". Nothing relating to existence can be
                incorporated into logical systems. Existence is opposite of
                finality.

                an't be settled. Quality of life depends on intensity, passion,
                decisiveness with which this relation is maintained.

                An objective uncertainty held fast in an appropriation-process
                of the most passionate inwardness is the truth, *the highest

                (culture, industry, art, technology) are us in objectified
                form. *Externalization* of ourselves makes us fully human.

                In industrial age, workers produce *commodities*.
                Their work is not an affirmation of themselves.

                Private property is *alienated labor*. Classical economists
