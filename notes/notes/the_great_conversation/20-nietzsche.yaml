                The Birth of Tragedy.

                Argued that Greeks used tragedy to solve the problem
                of "value of existence", with a plea for the relevance of
                that solution today.

                Nietzsche: Our perceptions of Greeks as "nobly simple, grandiose,
                calm, measured, harmonious, beautiful" do not fit tragedy
                (in particular, our knowledge of its origins).

        back: |
                Pessimism.

                Greeks looked into the abyss of human suffering without
                blinking - they experienced it and didn't look away.

                Quote: "What is best for you is *not to be born*, not to *be*,
                to be *nothing*; but the second best for you is &mdash;
                to die soon."

        topic: Friedrich Nietzsche
        front: How did Greeks find a way to live and rejoice?
        back: |
                (1) Tragedies often performed at religious festivals.
                These were serious business.

                (2) Writing plays was a competition, prizes were given for the
                best plays and playwrights were challenged.

                Nietzsche: For Greeks, everything was a contest.
                Greek ethos: competitive spirit *affirmed*, not *condemned*.

                (3) Tragedies unite 2 opposing forces of life: Apollo and
                Dionysus. Apollo: order, measure, restraint, "Know thyself."

                Apollo: right sort of gods to have, such gods live like humans,
                but splendidly. (No suggestion of ascetism, spirituality,
                duty.)

                Greeks created gods from a profound need. First: Titanic order
                of terror, then: Olympian divine order of joy, then: Apollonian
                impulse to beauty. (progression) This is how they endured
                suffering of existence. Their gods justify life of man.

                In tragedies, suffering is not withdrawn - it's presented,
                explored, given weight. Can't be explained as escape.

                Bacchus (or Dionysus): god of wine, excess, loss of control.
                Conventions left. Dionysian notes in lyric poetry, folk song.
                Desire, hate, envy, etc. expressed without reserve.

                Tragedy happens when Dionysus meets Apollo.

                Nietzsche accepts Schopenhauser's metaphysics, through not
                his evaluation of it. World of experience is merely appearance;
                *appearances* are just *will* made manifest. World is endless
                striving, wanting, desiring. As Kant taught, causality, space,
                time (principles that *individuate* things) only apply to
                phenomena, not to noumena (things in themselves) - so these
                principles don't apply to *will*.

                Realm of individuated phenomena: Apollo (measure, order,
                knowledge, morality), raging depths of urgent reality:
                Dionysus (intoxication breaks down distinctions and rules).
                Apollo governs the world of appearance, Dionysis expresses
                the will.

                Role of the *chorus*: often speaks/chants in unison.
                Interpretations: ideal spectators, political commentary
                (citizens commenting on actions of royalty).

                Nietzsch:

                1. Greek drama had no roles for individual actors, there was
                *only* the chorus.

                2. Chorus of *satyrs*, half-human half-goat companions of
                Dionysus.

                Tragedy is *religious* and *redeems*, and we can be *saved*
                through it.

                Why was chorus made from satyrs?
                Longing for primitive and natural, yet not a mere ape -
                archetype of man, embodiment of highest and most intense
                emotions. Satyrs were sublime and divine.

                Spectators identified with the satyr chorus. (i.e., "audience
                at rock concerts") Dionysian music originated in primordial
                reality - the *will* - from which derives all the apparent
                world, including the spectators.

                Drama is a *dream of the chorus*. Dionysian chorus dreams
                an Apollinian dream with the spectators.

                Experiencing tragic drama is like dreaming, when dreamer says
                "It's a dream! I will dream on!"

                How tragedies solve the problem of existence:
                In them, *individuals are destroyed*. It's a window into
                reality. Given Schopenhauer's metaphysics, our lives are
                *merely appearance* and not reality, we are a dream of will.
                Reality is in Dionysian depths with no individuation of space,
                time, causality. Chorus *affirms* the dream, including
                suffering and destruction, and *so spectators come to affirm
                life*, passionately, joyously. They know they are infinitely
                more than petty individualities of the apparent world. They
                experience fusion with the root of the world, and willing the
                creation of drama and their lives.

                Metaphysical comfort: at the bottom of things, despite changes
                in appearances, life is indestructibly powerful and
                pleasurable.

                Art saves Greeks from the Buddistic negation of the will.

                Tragedy exclaims: "We believe in eternal life"

                There are 2 kinds of pessimism: of weakness and of strength.
                Weakness: Schopenhauer - wants Buddhist relief from life.
                Strength: Greeks - joyous affirmation in face of terror.

                Our lives may turn out tragic, but there's nothing else that
                can give life meaning and solve the problem of the value
                of existence.

                What makes our life worth living is *not* anything moral, *not*
                another life, *not* our relation to God - just its *aesthetic
                value*. We are just "images and artistic projections for
                the true author" - primordial unity, will, Dionysian power.
                This can overcome pessimism. We can accept our lives even if
                we open our eyes to terrors. This is the *only* way the problem
                could be solved.

                Came to conclusion no metaphysical solution is available to us,

        front: Why can't we ever tell what there *really* is?
        back: |
                Every great philosophy so far was a personal confession of the
                author and a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir;
                if we want to explain how weird metaphysical claims came about,
                we should first ask: at which morality does the philosopher
                aim?

                Philosophy is about *psychology*. Philosophers believe they
                talk about ultimate reality, but at the bottom, there's always
                some "hunch", or an "inspiration" - more often a **desire**
                that has been filtered and made abstract, and then
                rationalized.

                Applies to "God", "soul", "free will", "the 'true' world",
                "morality", "cause", "substance", etc.
                He senses dishonesty, or even lying. (Suspicion shared
                with Kierkegaard.)
                Philosophy is this tyrannical drive itself, the most spiritual
                will to power, to the "creation of the world".

                Aside from *personal* needs, what *common* factors influence
                metaphysical views?
        back: |
                Grounded in language we speak or in our human nature.

                Our intellect produced some errors, which happen to be useful
                to preserve us: that there are enduring things, that there
                are things, substances, bodies; that our will is free;
                that what is good for me is good in itself.

                Kant's categories are also errors.

                The concept of *substance* is indispensable for logic,
                althrough nothing real corresponds to it.
                Same with *cause and effect*.

                Ancestors who had skeptical tendencies were in danger for life.

                Difference from Kant:
                (1) These concepts do *not* apply correctly to the phenomenal
                world.
                (2) There is no noumenal world of things-in-themselves that
                these concepts fall short of.
                They are just a pure necessity, we couldn't survive without
                these "errors". They *serve life*, but they aren't *true*.

                *Life is no argument.*

        back: |
                We place man back among the animals; he was no great hidden
                purpose of evolution. Not a crown of creation. Man is the
                most bungled of all animast, the sickliest, strays dangerously
                far from his instincts. Yet, we're the most interesting*.

                We are *machinas* as Descartes first said (through he excepted
                man). The will no longer *acts* or *moves*.

                We don't retreat to consciousness, which was previously
                said to be our link to divinity. Its development is just
                a symptom of relative imperfection of the organism:
                trying, groping, blundering - exercion which uses lots of
                nervous energy. We deny that anything can be done perfectly
                as long as it's done consciously. The "pure spirit" is
                pure stupidity; if we subtract the nervous system and the
                senses, we *miscalculate*.

                It just is. Those are all shadows of God.

                Nature is vacant of purposiveness and value.

                It's a religion of *pity*, which is the opposite of
                a life-affirming emotion - in pity, one *deplores*
                the condition of someone's existence. Pity is the reaction
                of God to mankind. "It would be better if life didn't exist
                at all."
                Nietzsche condemns Christianity for giving in to pessimism
                instead of overcoming it.

                Purported origin of "good"
        back: |
                It was originally used without reference to utility!

                Historical and linguistic evidence: "good" used by "the good"
                themselves - powerful, noble, high-stationed and high-minded
                who established themselves and their actions as good,
                in contradiction to the low-minded common plebs.
                They seized the right to create values and coin names for
                them!

                These people felt *themselves* as determining values!
                The value judgements presupposed powerful physique, flourishing
                health, adventure, dances, war games, etc.

                The morality of conquerors is held in check by custom, respect,
                gratitude, their relations to each other. With strangers, they
                savor a freedom from all social constraints.

                Categories: good/evil.
                Different psychological dynamics: "evil" is a primary concept
                and is driven not by affirmation, but by negation
                (not a "yes" to life, but "no").

                Slaves are by definition powerless to the nobles, who call
                themselves "the good".
                Slave revolt in morality begins when *resentment itself
                becomes creative and gives rise to values*.

                Slave morality says "no" to the different, to the outside, to
                what is not itself.
                **In order to exist, slave morality first needs a hostile
                external world. Its action is fundamentally reaction.**

                The *evil* of slave morality is the *good* of the master
                morality, seen by *resentment*.

                For slaves, the *good* would be like them: poor, weak, humble,
                serving. "Good" is absence of "evil" - resistance to
                domineering arrogance of nobles.

                We want to be comfortable, easily satisfied, without pain
                and suffering - "happy". And we think everyone has a
                right for this.

                Zarathustra compares preachers of equality to tarantulas:

                Reverenge sits in your souls. Your poison makes the soul
                whirl with reverenge.
                Behind "equality" and "justice for all" there is hatred,
                reverenge, resentment, spite. We have to see that our
                values are based on lies.

                The "virtues" of slave morality are things slaves *cannot help*
                but do. The weak, however, interpret them as something

                Doctrine of free will was invented to *punish* - to *impute

                The overman is the *meaning of the earth*. You and I cannot

                Overman will remain faithful to Earth and not hanker for

                (1) Starts as a camel -- seeks out what is most difficult
                and loads it on his bck. Discipline, obedience, bearing
                heavy burdens is part of his training. A spirit that would
                attain great heights cannot *begin* there. Analogue with
                Nietzsche's philology: everyone has to start with Plato,
                Aristotle and Kant.

                (2) In loneliest desert, becomes a lion: would conquer his freedom
                and be master in his own desert. Wants to fight the great
                dragon, named "You shalt". The spirit of the lion says
                "I will". The lion says "No!" to all "you shalt"'s and opens
                a space for freedom, to create new values.

                (3) Hence, he becomes a child. The child is innocence, forgetting,
                a new beginning. A sacred "Yes" to the game of creation -
                of values.

                Not heedlessly. His values are expressions of who he is.

                *We want to become who we are* - human beings who create
                themselves.

                To become who one is, one must not have the faintest notion
                of *what* one is. Consciousness - its surface - must be kept
                clear of all great imperatives. Beware every great word,
                every great pose!

                He first trains all *subservient* capacities before giving
                any hint of the dominant "aim", "task" or "meaning".

                Overman does not lie back and wait to unfold.
                He must be *hard*. Demands much, most of all from himself.

                The overman is the poet of his life, both creates the work

                Life is what must always overcome itself.
                Whatever I create, I must soon oppose it - thus the will wills
                it. Will to power is not the *conscious* will; it is the
                intention to which we normally ascribe action. Will to power
                is *life itself* climbing over itself.
                It's not Schopenhauer's will - it's a characterisation of our
                life in *this* world.
                Even knowledge is driven by desire, interest, will. (We should
                add perspectives to gain *height* from which an overman
                can survey the truth.)

                Will to power motivates the slave rebellion in morality.

                Overman is what life - all life - is drives toward.
                Life of an overman is beyond reverenge and without resentment.
                No blaming, no accusations, no complaining, no victim-think.
                No self-pity. *No pity at all.*
                An overman is strong enough for pain, struggles, suffering.
                More to the point, he's *grateful* for it.

                Exploitation is essential to life.
