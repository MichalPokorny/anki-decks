                Argument for existence of God
        back: |
                <ul>
                <li> Say that, than which no greater can be conceived,
                only exists in understanding, not in reality.
                <li> Then it's not <i>that, than which no greater can be
                conceived</i>. We can conceive of something greater, which
                exists in both senses.
                </ul>

                Claims existence of God is *self-evident* and moves from his
                *essence* to *existence*.

                Cannot be material, because an object is known
                by how the material is actualized. Cannot be
                form, because then definitions of real objects wouldn't
                differ from mathematical objects.

                A self-evident proposition is not always
                self-evident to us. A proposition is self-evident
                when the predicate forms part of what the subject
                means. Such self-evident propositions will not be
                self-evident to people to whom the meanings
                are not evident.
                <br><br>
                We need to start somewhere lower.
                This is required because of the Aristotelian view
                of knowledge acquisition.

        back: |
                We see efficient causes. Nothing can be its own
                efficient cause. So there was a first efficient
                cause - God.
                It the series were infinite, there would be
                no cause which is "first", so there would be no
                intermediate causes and no ultimate causes.

                <li> If everything can possibly not-be, then at one time
                nothing existed. How could anything have begun to exist?
                <li> So, something must exists necessarily.
                <li> By chain (similar to Efficient Causality/Motion),
                there must be something that has of itself its own necessity,
                and causing in others their necessity &rarr; God.

                Everything that comes in grades (e.g. hotness)
                has a most-hot prototype/cause (fire).
                So, there is something which
                is to all beings the cause of their being, goodness,
                and every other perfection - God.
                <br><br>
                2 points: *comparison* with fire, *cause* by fire

                "God is good" doesn't mean "God causes goodness" or "God is not

                "Wise", "good" etc. learned by application to creatures, which

                an extra attribute.

                Problem with God's omnipotence
        back: |
                "Intuitive cognition" of an apple is usually caused by
                an apple and some things about us (e.g., not being drugged).
                <br><br>
                Having the experience without an actual apple wouldn't be
                self-contradictory &rarr; God could cause it.
                <br><br>
                Knowledge comes from *certainty*, so we can't be certain
                there's a tangerine if we perceive one.
                <br><br>
                So with causation: what if fire doesn't cause cloth
                to burn, but God always intervenes?
                <br><br>
                Maybe reason and theology are incompatible!

        back: |
                By late 14th century cardinal Pierre d'Ailly.
                Look at "first mover":
                <ul>
                <li> Not evident that anything is moved.
                     Movement is only apparent.
                <li> How do we know movement comes from some other
                     object?
                <li> Okay, say there's a first mover.
                     What if first mover is unmoved for the present,
                     but not absolutely unmovable?
                <li> What if there's a circularity of cause and effect?
                <li> What if God in His absolute power created
                     an infinite series of essentially ordered causes?
                <li> etc etc etc.
                </ul>
