                Death, the most dreaded of evils, is therefore of

                present, and when death is present we no longer exist.
                It is therefore nothing either to the living or to
                the dead since it is not present to the living, and

                Going after some not worth it, causes unhappiness (e.g.,
                luxury, following every sexual passion). We should control and

                for the enjoyment of luxury if at intervals we chance
                to meet with it, and it renders us fearless against
                fortune."

                about death that it is dreadful - *that* is what
                is dreadful. So when we are upset or distressed,

                Okay and natural to eat when hungry, it's our nature (see:
