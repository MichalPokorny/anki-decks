                and Church of England vs. rising middle classes
                and Protestant dissenters.

                Outcome: long civil war, King Charles I executed, period of
                government without king under Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell,
                then Restoration of monarchy under Charles II

                This motivates removing the state of nature.

                defend ourselves.*
                Those are 1 right and 1 law.

                Some of our natural liberty must be given up.

                Second law: lay down the right to all things, be

                Does a mature me have the same soul as me as a child?

                What actually gives me the idea of *myself* at all
                is consciousness.
                Our identity reaches as far back as our consciousness
                does. We remember past experiences of our past selves.
                Personal identity isn't sameness of substance,
                including sameness of *soul* substance.

                Locke: "probable" that 1 soul is attached to 1 consciousness.

                Commonwealth: society of men advancing their Civil
                Interests -- life, liberty, health, possession, etc.
                Duty of Civil Magistrate: impartially execute
                equal laws, secure possessions.

                Church: voluntary society, men joining for public
                worship of God.
                Civil authorities have no business here,
                same as ecclesiastical authorities shouldn't try
                to gain worldly power.
                Civil power obligated to tolerate differences
                in which men seek to relate to God. Care of every
                man's soul belongs unto himself.

                Counterargument: Religious dissenters were historically
                dangerous to civil order.
                Counter-counterargument: Just because they were discriminated.

                male nor female.

                Berkeley: Nonsense. Mind *has no power to frame abstract ideas
                or notions of things*. Idea of "man" would have *some* color,
                but at the same time *no color in particular*.

                We may have *general* ideas, but no **abstract** general ideas.

                Their generality is not in their intrinsic nature, but in how
                we use them.

                Every word and idea is particular.

                "Tiger" has universal significance not because it stands for
                an abstract idea (there is none), but because those letters and
                sounds refer to any tiger. Thinking such words are *names* is
                abuse of language.

                Things, which are in their nature particular, are rendered

                What is there, besides ideas?
        back: |
                Something perceiving those, wills, remembers, etc.:
                MIND/SPIRIT/SOUL/MYSELF. Spirit is subject of knowledge, ideas
                are objects. We don't have an *idea* of it, but we have a
                *notion* of spirit.

        back: |
                Only spirit, and ideas.

                How does he defend there being only spirit and ideas,
                when he wanted to defend common sense?
        back: |
                Ideas exist only *as perceived*. That is even true
                of sensations.
                Things exist only insofar as *there could be something
                perceiving them*.
                There is *no abstract idea of existence*.

                Skeleton of argument: a table exists only as perceived
        back: |
                <ol type="1">
                <li> A table is a sensible thing.
                <li> Sensible things are perceived by sense.
                <li> Whatever is perceived by sense is a sensation.
                <li> No sensation can exist unperceived.
                <li> So, no table can exist unperceived.
                <li> To say that table exists unperceived is to say
                "This table, which exists only as perceived,
                exists unperceived"

                How does he defend the principle that things continue
                existing even when not perceived?
        back: |
                While we can, in imagination, combine attributes as we want,
                this cannot be done with senses. With respect to senses, we are
                passive.

                Ideas are *inert* - causally inactive. It's never the case that
                one idea causes another one to appear.

                Sensations and ideas do not *act*.

                Will. By reflection, we find causal power there.

                What is the appeal of atheism, and his refusal?
        back: |
                Idea that material has independent existence and causal power
                to produce sensations in us.

                Idea of mind-independent material substance is grotesque, full
                of contradiction.

                Why is our experience regular and well-ordered?
        back: |
                We are not in control of the ideas we call *the world*. So, if
                we get our epistemology and metaphysics straight, there is
                a new and simple proof of God.

                We know of God the same way I know of your spirit.

                This is why things have an independent existence from us: God
                perceives them.
