                Not just private life, but also policits, changing laws
                and society.

                They demanded parliamentary reform, prison reform, extension
                of the right to vote, full legal rights for women, greater
                democracy, more accountability of government officials,
                changes in punishments, etc.

                Principle of utility is a sharp tool for reformers;
                pinpoints social evils, suggests remedies.

                Mill says Bentham sees very far and clearly, but narrowly.

                Bentham: pleasure is pleasure, quantity being equal, watching
                reality TV is as good as Shakespeare.

                Mill: Obviously not true. Pleasures also differ in quality,
                even if they have the same quantity.

                Bentham claims legislation and morality might be made scientific.
                Qualities are not so quantifiable.

        front: J. S. Mill on which pleasures are more desirable
        back: |
                "Oftwo pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all
                who have experience of both give a decided preference,
                irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it,
                that is the more pleasurable experience."

                (We have to set aside feelings of moral obligation - since
                morality is something we're trying to decide in the first
                place!)

                If there's a split, the majority should win (in politics).
                In personal life, we can better know the particular things
                that make particular people happy.

                Why is the principle of utility the *first* moral principle -
                not Kantian deontology, virtue ethics, Christianity, etc.?
        back: |
                Both Bentham and Mill address this.

                Bentham: consider the alternatives (in various versions and
                disguises).

                Principle of ascetism: judging many actions to be
                right that deny pleasure to them or others (e.g., Stoics,
                Luther beating himself for his sins).

                Counterarguments:

                1. Never applied consistently. A monk doesn't torture himself
                because it's good in itself, but because he judges it necessary
                for bliss. Stoics see that some pleasures result in pain,
                but they wrongly generalize that pleasures are never good.
                Nonetheless, they praise virtue, which (according to Bentham)
                produces pleasure without pains. So, Stoics reject utility
                inconsistently.

                2. Ascetism has never been applied to government. No politician
                ever aimed at making arsonists, housebreakers and bandits
                rulers. Govenment allows criticism of increased misery of
                populace.

                Principle of sympathy: approve or disapprove not on account
                of whether actions tend to happiness, but whether man finds
                himself disposed to approve or disapprove of them.

                This is not a principle, but a denial that a principle is
                needed. People often cloak their prejudices in fine words.
                God, good order, reason, etc. come down to whether
                the individual approves or disapproves.

                None of us can continue to call something *morally right*
                if we clearly imagine it ending in misery, for no further
                good.

        front: Mill's 2 remarkably poor arguments for questions of ultimate ends
        back: |
                <ul><li>
                The only proof capable of being given is visible objects,
                people seeing it; audible sounds and people hearing it; and
                so with other sources of experience.
                The only evidence that something is desirable is that people
                desire it.

                Problem: "Desirable" does not mean "can be desired", but
                "should be desired", so the fact that something *is* desired
                doesn't mean it *ought* to be desired.
                <li>
                Happiness is a good, each person's happiness is a good to that
                person, so general happiness is good to the aggregate of all
                persons.

                Problem: Doesn't follow that *your* happiness is a good
                for *me*.

        back: |
                <ul>
                <li> Aiming at pleasure is aiming too low: Mill says we require
                more than pigs to be made happy: "It is better to be a human
                being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be
                a Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool,
                or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they
                only know their own side of the question."
                <li> Utilitarian standard is unrealizable, not everyone
                can be happy.
                Response: even it is impossible, the principle would still
                be valid. Second: it's an exaggeration to say that happiness
                - even the general happiness - is impossible.

                "When people who are tolerably fortunate in their outward lot
                do not find in life sufficient enjoyment to make it valuable
                to them, the cause generally is caring for nobody but
                themselves."

                And, Mill on how to achieve happiness (hedonistic paradox).
                <li>
                Doesn't utilitarianism undercut character, virtue?
                Shouldn't we admire people who sacrifice personal happiness?

                Response: Sacrifics for others is not good in itself - it is
                only admirable if it increases total happiness.
                <li>
                It is too demanding.

                Response: Ethics tells us what is right and wrong, but it
                doesn't go as far as saying everything should be done from
                a certain *motive* (note: differs from Kant, for whom
                etical actions are only from duty).

                Motivations don't matter for judgement of *actions*,
                through they may inform our estimates about the *agent*.
                <li>
                Utilitarianism renders men cold and calculating.

                Response: Utilitarianism does not forbid valuing character.
                In the long run, best proof of a good character is good
                actions.
                <li>
                Utilitarianism is godless, only counts worldly happiness.

                Response: Depends of how you think of God. If God wants
                happiness of all creatures and that's why he made them,
                then utility is not godless, but profoundly religious.
                <li>
                Principle of utility is impractical, we have to act quickly
                in making a choice.

                Response (Mill): That's the same as if you said we can't read
                the New and Old Testaments every time we decide.
                We are always learning by experience the tendencies of actions.
                Utility does not rule out common wisdom. Secondary rules may
                be gradually improved.

                Mill: Bentham's great value is in trying to improve subordinate
                principles - social institutions and law.

                Severe depression in early 20's, exited with new certainty that
                happiness is test of all conduct, the end of life -- but
                (paradox of hedonism) can't be attained by directly aiming at
                it - happy people focus on some object: happiness of others,
                improvement of mankind, etc. Pleasures of life make it
                pleasurable when taken *en passant*, witout being a principal
                object. Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you will cease
                to be so. Only chance is to treat not happiness, but some end
                external to it.

                Happiness is a by-product. (this somehow reconsiles virtue

        front: Utilitarianism and justice
        back: |
                Can utilitarianism be the sole moral principle?
                Or must we incorporate justice, which resists calculation of
                consequences?

                (E.g., execute an innocent to prevent a riot.)

                Mill: Justice is a special case of utility.
                Subjective feeling from utility and justice is different
                (stronger for justice). Justice is associated with *rights* -
                *legal* rights and *moral* rights. (People may have moral
                rights even absent legal protection.) Injustice leads to
                resentment, so we want to punish, particularly violations of
                moral rights.

                Rights are things I have a claim on society to protect. What's
                the origin of rights? On what grounds does society owe me?

                Mill: No reason besides general utility, and none is needed.
                *Security* is very fundamental to happiness, so much to make
                it a right.

                Mill: *Justice* is about moral rules concerning essentials of
                human well-being.

                abolished? Because the empowered class is the entire male
                sex, not a limited class.
                Women have strongest motivation to seek favour of men
                and avoiding to give them offence.

                Counterargument: Why don't women complain?

                Countercounterargument:
                <ul type="1">
                <li> Some do.
                <li> Pattern: subjects of power of ancient origin begin by
                complaining about its abuse, not about the power; plenty of
                complaints from wives of abusive husbands.
                <li> Men don't want just obedience, they also want sentiment
                (willing slaves). They enslave women's *minds* - not just
                on *fear*. The entire force of education indoctrinates women.
                </ul>

                Popular books: "women exist for the sake of men".
                Ask boys: "to what purpose are you talking?", ask girls:
                "how will your discourse be received?"
                Women should never say anything disagreeable.

                <li> *Undermining of female morality*: putting on a show, no
                substance; virtue and its shadow at variance.
                <li> *Women persuaded to value trivialities* - attractiveness,
                decorum. Turned to sensuality, away from understanding.
                "A virtuous woman" has sexual connotations, "a virtuous man"
                has none - "women are, foremost, pleasers!!"
                <li> *Attention only on perceived virtuous chastity*. If honour
                of a woman is safe, she may ruin her family by gaming, yet
                present a shameless front.
                <li> *Weakening of women by their existence being justifiable
                only in terms of relations to another*. And they are *brought
                up to be weak*.
                Submisiveness, meekness, resignation were an essential part
                of sexual attractiveness.
                <li> *Women become cunning by necessity*. Can't have money
                or property &rarr; arise jealousy, etc. Understanding has been
                denied to women; instinct sublimated into wit, cunning was
                substituted. Also, *meddlesomeness*.
                <li> *Men considerate of their wives' opinions are often made
                worse by their influence*. Women seldom have honest and
                conscientious opinions. They know what will bring
                money/invitations/good marriages to kids, but not what is right
                in politics. Lack straightforward rationality, so they govern
                their husband indirectly, sneakily.
