                Aristocrats fear for power and tried to purge
                citizenship rolls.
                Assembly passed proposal extending citizenship to
                many new residents.
                3-day siege of Acropolis by the people.
                King, aristocrats and soldiers capitulated.

                citizens controlled major decisions.

                This ensued for the next ~100 years, and (with some
                exceptions) some time after that.

                have to pay me &rarr; he has to pay."

                can represent or misrepresent reality. Sophists think we can't
