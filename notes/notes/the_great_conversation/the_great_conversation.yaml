                Anaximander předpokládá balanci, která musí být
                navrácena, ať převážil kterýkoli element.
                Je to extenze Homerova vidění (který vykresloval balanci
                emocí - hněv, pýcha vedou k boží odplatě).
                Tento princip podle Anaximandra platí i všude ve světě,
                nejen mezi lidmi.
                Tento princip taky není od bohů, ale od světa samotného.
                Takhle podle Anaximandra svět prostě funguje - to je
                odpojení od Homéra (s Thaletem).

                Release bonds to the body.
                The separation of the soul is actual death.
                So philosophers are training for dying and they
                fear death least of all men.

        back: |
                Men are happy when their soul is in excellent shape &mdash;
                all 3 parts function properly.
                <br>
                The source of unhappiness is a lack of harmony in
                soul. Reason makes the decisions, supported by spirit,
                desire is channeled appropriately.
                <br><br>
                Justice happens when people are in harmony.
                Soul is happy when it is in harmony, hence "just".
                We have *social justice* and *internal personal justice*.
                Plato needs to show that *social justice* is good
                for the individual.
                *Internal justice*, it has been shown, is good for itself.
                <br>
                To be unjust is to allow the "internal beast" to rule
                and overwhelm "the man within".
                To be good is to be just,
                so the Form of Justice takes us to the Form of the Good.

                Change is a movement from something potential to
                something actual; pure substances have to be pure
                *actualities*, because the principle of potentiality is

                potentiality to be less than best,
                and that's due to matter.

                <br><br>
                *In general*: soul doesn't feel pity, learn or think -
                man does. Sometimes those penetrate to soul.
                <br><br>
                Sensation starts from particular objects;
                recollection starts from soul.
                Sensation cannot occur without body. Recollections
                have bodily effects (e.g., running to catch a bus).
                A person is *one being* with *one essence*.
                <br><br>
                Soul is a *substance*, inasmuch as it is the form of
                a natural body that potentially possesses life.
                A soul is a form for a *primary substance*.

                by practicing until they become habits. <i>Can be taught.</i>

                independent. Often, brave men are not moderate. In perfection,

                A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
                and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat
                him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
                Now by chance a priest was going down that road;
                and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.
                So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place
                and saw him, passed by on the other side.
                But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he
                was; and when he saw him, he had compassion,
                and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on
                oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast
                and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
                And the next day he took out two denarii and gave
                them to the innkeeper, saying: "Take care of him;
                and whatever more you spend, I will repay you
                when I come back". Which of these three, do you think,
                proved neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?
                <br><br>
                He said: "The one who showed mercy on him."
                <br><br>

        back: |
                We cannot recognize truth just by being told it,
                words are at most *signs*. They represent some reality.
                Some words signify other signs ("noun"),
                some signify realities ("horse").
                Knowledge may be expressed as signs, but not necessarily.
                We do not learn from words - we must understand.
                Words are at best reminders.
                We don't consult a speaker, but the truth he has within.
                Christ is who teaches, inside all of us. Every rational
                minds consults him. Everyone receives as much as he
                can because of his own good or bad will.
                The inner light is like the light of the Sun.
                God is, God is apprehended and God causes other
                things to be apprehended.
                Noone ever teaches another person anything.
                For Augustine, we learn by contronting realities,
                illuminated by the Interion Teacher: Christ.

                Being is good, evil is lack of being. Since Parmenides, what
                *is not* does not exist. The good things are reality.
                <br><br>
                Because things lack some qualities doesn't make them evil.
                By necessity, not everything can be perfect (like God is).
                <br><br>
                Evil only exists where there is good, nothing is evil per se.

        back: |
                Only an infinitesimal instant. When time is present, it has no
                duration - the knife edge between *what is not yet* and *what
                is no longer*.
                <br><br>
                Speaking accurately: memory = *present of things past*,
                direct awareness = *present of things present*, expectation =
                *present of things future*. These times all exist in the mind.
                <br><br>
                Time has no meaning apart from the mind, so it *must* have come
                into being with creation. Minds are not eternal.
                <br><br>
                In possessing expectation, attention and memory, minds are
                where time realizes itself. As such, they are a faint image of
                God, who also sees past, present and future. God lives in
                "never-ending present" - knows all time at once.

                Will commits sin when it turns away from immutable and common

                Pride is the root of sin.
                "God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will
                be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good
                and evil." They wanted to be "like God".
                <br><br>
                The original sin: man regards himself as his own
                light, and turns away from that light which would
                make man himself a light if he would
                set his heart on it.
                <br><br>
                There is no efficient cause of an evil choice. It's not
                a matter of efficiency, but of deficiency.
                <br>
                If there were a cause for evil, it would - since it is - be
                good. The cause for sin is that incomplete being of the will is
                a *necessary condition* for sin. If sin had an efficient cause,
                it would not be subject to punishment.

                "God is good" doesn't mean "God causes goodness" or "God is not

                "Intuitive cognition" of an apple is usually caused by

                <br><br>
                Having the experience without an actual apple wouldn't be

                Knowledge comes from *certainty*, so we can't be certain

                <li> Not evident that anything is moved.

                     What if first mover is unmoved for the present,

                Topic: Apology for Raymond Sebond
        back: |
                Montaigne translated Sebond's book to French
                at his father's request. Set out to defend Sebond's
                thesis (apology: defense, as with Socrates).

                Strategy:
                <ul>
                <li> Christianity depends entirely on faith
                <li> Sebond's proofs can be used to demonstrate
                     anything. His arguments are as solid as any others
                     of the same type that may be opposed by them.
                <li> Therefore, arguments for are as good as arguments
                     against.
                </ul>

                Montaigne wonders: Are we superior to animals at all?
                Who are we to know? We also obviously can't trust our
                senses. We are often deceived by reason. Science
                progresses and theories are always overthrown later.
                It's difficult or impossible to know the truth
                about the universe.

                Other creatures may have natural laws, but they
                are lost in us. Human reason "butts in everywhere",
                confusing things with vanity and inconsistency.
                Truth about right and wrong is unavailable to us.
                (Similar to Pico, but this is *despair*, not glory.)

                Our justifications go in circles or in infinite
                regress. Nothing can be established about anything. Our
                senses may not even correspond at all to external
                realities. We can't even find out whether they do.

                *Skepticism used as a defence of the status quo.*
                Montaigne brought up a Catholic, sensible
                thing is to keep customs we grew up in.

                Each thing as far as in it lies, continues always

                continues to move.

                All motion is of itself in a straight line.
                Things which move in circles tend to recede from
                the centre of the circle.

                Aristotle: all things tend to the center, and don't
                want to keep moving. This only makes sense in an

                3 problems with Descartes's views
        back: |
                <ul>
                <li> <i>Place of humans in nature</i>:
                        Are we cogs in a machine? Is there
                        room for purposes? Do we have free will?

                        Descartes's solution: radically split mind and
                        body.

                        We aren't automata (we have language),
                        we are more flexible and adaptable than any
                        machine.
                <li> <i>Mind-Body</i>.
                        Descartes: mind and body are separate,
                        yet we are a unity. How can we be at the same
                        time two and one?
                <li> <i>God and skepticism</i>.
                        If God deceives or doesn't exist,
                        it's a big problem.

                Commonwealth: society of men advancing their Civil
                Interests -- life, liberty, health, possession, etc.
                Duty of Civil Magistrate: impartially execute
                equal laws, secure possessions.

                Church: voluntary society, men joining for public
                worship of God.
                Civil authorities have no business here,
                same as ecclesiastical authorities shouldn't try
                to gain worldly power.
                Civil power obligated to tolerate differences
                in which men seek to relate to God. Care of every
                man's soul belongs unto himself.

                Counterargument: Religious dissenters were historically
                dangerous to civil order.
                Counter-counterargument: Just because they were discriminated.

                How does Locke abuse language?
        back: |
                Locke: We have universal words, general words are *names* for
                abstract ideas. "Tiger" means "what is common to all tigers",
                neither small nor large tiger, not male or female.

                Berkeley: Nonsense. Mind *doesn't have a power to frame
                abstract ideas or notions of things*. Idea of "man" would have
                *some* color, but at the same time *no color in particular*.

                We don't actually have an *idea* of existence (of *nothing
                in particular*), same with *substance*, *solidity*, etc.

        back: |
                We may have *general* ideas, but no **abstract** general ideas.

                Their generality is not in their intrinsic nature, but in how
                we use them.

                Every word and idea is particular.

                "Tiger" has universal significance not because it stands for
                an abstract idea (there is none), but because those letters and
                sounds refer to any tiger. Thinking such words are *names* is
                abuse of language.

                Things, which are in their nature particular, are rendered
                universal by relations.

                particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light

                If any one upon serious and unprejudic'd reflexion,
                thinks he has a different notion of *himself*, I must
                confess I can reason no longer with him. All I can

                Author: "In every system of morality, which I have
                hitherto met with, I have always remark'd, that the
                author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of
                reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or
                makes observations about human affairs; when of
                a sudden I am surpriz'd to find, that instead of
                the usual copulations of propositions, *is*, and
                *is not*, I meet with no proposition that is not
                connected with an *ought*, or *ought not*. This change
                is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last
                consequence. For as this *ought* or *ought not*,
                expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis
                necessary that it shou'd be observ'd and explain'd;
                and at the same time that a reason should be given,
                for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this
                new relation can be a deduction from others,
                which are entirely different from it. But as authors
                do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume
                to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that
                this small attention wou'd subvert all the vulgar
                [i.e., common] systems of morality, and let us see,
                that the distinction of vice and virtue is not

                objects*. Drop representational theory of truth.

                We can't know whether our ideas correspond
                to an idea-less object. On the basis
                of concepts, we can know nothing outside our minds.
                All of this follows from: 1. we are acquainted
                only with experienced ideas, 2. objects exist
                independently of our experience, 3. knowledge
                requires that we ascertain correspondence between
                ideas and objects.

                What is objects only exist if they are related
                to a rational mind?

                Maybe objects of experience are constructions of
                rational mind, and have no reality independent
                of their construction. Rational minds have some
                structure (including, e.g. causality), and the
                structure is **imposed** on objects known by them.

                A) epistemological question: does it rest on experience,
                or not?

                B) semantic question: how do the meanings of the
                words we use to express the knowledge relate to each
                other?

                1. Epistemological:

                1a: A priori: known to be true without any reference
                to experience (7+5=12)

                1b. A posteriori: when we must appeal to experience
                to determine truth or falsity.

                2. Semantic:

                2a: Analytic: when its denial yields a contradiction.
                For example: "All bodies are extended."
                (The predicate "extended" is already included in "body".)
                If an analytical judgement is true, it is necessarily
                true. (Every father has a child.)

                2b. Synthetic: does more than explicate or analyze
                a concept. "Every event has a cause.", "Air has weight."
                The opposite of synthetic judgements is always
                possible.

                for contradiction, so we also don't have to examine
                experience.
                All analytic judgements must be a priori.

                There is only 1 infinite substance (which exists
                in itself). This is "God of Nature". Individuals
                and our experience are just its modifications.

                Mind and body are not substances, but attributes
                under which the one substance can be conceived.

                For every natural body, there is an idea.
                The mind is the idea corresponding to a human body.
                Mind and body are identical, mental changes
                and bodily changes isomorphic.

                There is no free will, because everything is a necessary
                expression of the divine nature. Freedom is just
                the power to act from one's own nature.
                God is the only completely free being.

                We are *in bondage* of emotions (love, desire, hate).
                Emotions are *caused in us*. We move towards freedom
                by intellectual love of God, coming to see necessities
                of the world as God sees them. This knowledge is the
                source of power to act (rather than react), virtue
                and joy; thus we can approximate the blessed life
                of God.

                Solution to free will
        back: |
                Distinction between noumena and phenomena.

                Every event can be both natural and free.
                Thinking that we can only be free or only deterministic
                is a presumptuous position of *absolute reality*.

                Every appearance has 2 aspects: it's something that
                appears in the world of our experience, it's something
                in itself.

                As appearance, a part of the world of nature,
                it's governed by nature's principles.
                In this aspect, every action is causally determined.

                But as a thing in itself, we can't even say
                it occurs in time!
                And the category of causality doesn't extend beyond
                the bounds of experience, so an act of will may even
                be *absolutely* free as in Descartes.

                Concept of "that than which nothing greater

                All alleged examples are taken from *judgements*,
                not from things and their existence. But necessity of
                judgements is not the same as absolute necessity of
                things. If we reject the absolutely necessary being, we
                reject the thing itself with all its predicates; so
                then there is no contradiction.

                (Rejecting 3 angles in a triangle is a contradiction.
                Rejecting the triangle altogether is not.)

                Counterargument: When atheists reject God, they *must*
                have a concept of it to reject it.

                Counter-counterargument:
                "Being" is obviously not a real predicate.
                It's not a concept of something that could be added
                to the concept of a thing. It's just the positing
                of a thing as existing in themselves.

                ("Being" / "existence" is not a predicate in the sense
                "being a triangle" is. To say that some concept has
                *being* means claiming that the concept *applies*
                to something.)

                *Every* judgement of existence is *synthetic*.

                Hypotheticals would apply only if my wants are

                regardless of my wants.

                Moral law must:
                <ul>

                <li> Make no reference to consequences

        back: |
                When we find discrepancy between awareness and its
                objects, consciousness corrects itself to make
                awareness more adequate. But the object has not stayed
                put, so we see that what we thought the object *is*,
                now it just *appears to be*. It formerly had
                the status of *thing-in-itself*, and now it's
                seen as having been an object *just for us*.
                Thus the reality-appearance distinction arises
                *within consciousness*.

                Previous philosophers naively thought it existed
                *between* consciousness and something
                independent of consciousness.

                Phenomenology traces the dialectical succession
                of more and more adequate stages of consciousness.

                Impelled to go beyond it. Internal dialectic forces

                Sense-certainty "attempts to be" simply sense-certainty,
                tries to *negate itself*. It tries to know just
                what is present to it. But it fails, and the insufficency
                of that attempt is displayed in itself.
                The attempt *necessarily* involves "this", "here",
                "now", "I".

                This negation is *not* skepticism - it's a determinate
                and specific negation of sufficiency of sense-certainty
                for knowledge.

                Hegel: His dialectic covers everything consciousness can ever
                be aware of. Everywhere, consciousness discovers itself.
                In every explanation, it finds its own imposed values, laws,
                truths. Consciousness *itself* is unconditioned, this stage
                Hegel calls *reason*. Reason is certainty of consciousness that

                into a positive relation. Up till now it has been
                concerned only with its independence and freedom,
                concerned to save and maintain itself for itself at
                the expense of the *world*, or of its own actuality,
                both of which appeared to it as the negative of its
                essence. But as Reason, assured of itself, it is at
                peace with them, and can endure them; for it is certain
                that it is itself reality, or that everything actual
                is none other than itself; its thinking is itself
                directly actuality, and thus its relationship to the
                latter is that of idealism...

                These "liberal" theorists identify themselves only with
                their nonreflective, rationally uncriticized, given
                desires (compare what Stoics and Skeptics did).
                It's an *arbitrary will*.

                If we think we're free when we can do what our
                *arbitrary will* says, its own *arbitrariness* implies
                that we are not free.

                To be free, we must be *rational*, and since
                rationality is intrinsically *universal*, we must be
                *ethical*.
                Reason cannot be the slave of the passions - it must
                be a determining factor in action.

                We need to synthesize the Stoic/Skeptical view with

                Origin of state as social contract between individuals
                is, to Hegel, an undue abstraction.
                An individual per se is an *abstraction* from the whole.
                The community (the *State*) is the bearer of objective
                reality of spirit, "higher" than the individual.
                The state is an organism.

                It must be rational and have impartial and universal
                laws, and rational and free individuals can give
                their rational and free consent to it. The state
                is the correlate of reason.

                Most of us live in various degrees of self-deception.
                We are not honest with ourselves about categories
                that actually structure our lives.

                His characters are for identifying with and then revealing

                Just wants to *be something*. "You are the music while
                the music lasts." Wants complete absorption in
                pleasurable moments. Wants to evade reflection,
                self-consciousness, thought, choice, having
                to *become* something. Wants to enjoy *immediacy*
                (Hegel criticizes it as foundation for knowledge).

                Realizes it's not possible, immediacy doesn't exist
                if sought.

                A reflects on Don Juan. He is undifferentiated,
                unreflective desire. A: Sensuality is not human
                reality, but an aspect of it - an abstraction
                (Hegel's critique of immediacy, Epicureanism).

                He tries to make his life into a work of art, for
                aesthetic appreciation. He doesn't want it to be
                *boring* - that would be a terrible review of
                a movie.

                His basic evaluation of everything is a pair of
                concepts: *interesting/boring*.
                *Rotation of Crops*: how to keep things interesting.
                Recommends:
                <ul>
                <li> *Variety*. Varying surroundings and circumstances
                is "vulgar and unartistic". Instead, *vary yourself*.
                The key is remembering and forgetting artistically,
                not randomly.
                <li> *Beware entanglements, avoid commitments*.
                To have absolute freedom to break away from anything.
                No friendships (but many acquaintances), no marriage,
                no business.
                <li> *Stay in control*. Don't necessarily get what's
                best for you, but what you ask for.

                Origin in levels of possibilities - accentuates
                "this is not your life".

                Johaness, diarisst, is fascinated by young girl, Cordelia.

                Insinuates himself into her family, pays much attention
                to Cordelia's aunt, makes himself
                look interesting. Promotes Edward, a conventional and
                boring young man in love with Cordelia, as a match for
                Cordelia. Slowly, he brings Cordelia to see Edward -
                compared to him - as boring. He manipulates an engagement
                with himself, subtly influences her to believe marriage
                is an impediment to *true love*. *She* breaks the
                engagement. Passionate night together, then he leaves her.

                The seducer is an opposite of Don Juan. The seducer
                lives completely in reflection, only occasionally
                touches reality. Schemes, plts, etc.
                He enjoys building the drama.
                Keeps distance from everything, including himself.
                He claims to love Cordelia -- in the esthetic sense.
                And to be benefiting her - by *making her life more
                interesting* - he will leave her a sophisticated
                woman. He taught her the terrors of the possible.

        back: |
                A is splintered into many semi-selves.

                Judge William: "mark" of romantic love is *immediacy*.
                Falling in love is something that *happens*.

                Lovers are deeply convinced their relationship is
                something whole that can't be really changed.
                This conviction is false, since it's something that
                *just happens*.

                Cynism about love leads to (1) resigning on lasting
                love, having a series of affairs, (2) marriage
                of convenience without love.
                Judge William deplores both.
                A is right in valuing romantic love, but promise of
                eternity requires not "going with the flow", but
                choice - determination of will.

                *Conjugal love* - mark of that is engagement of the

                and permanence, and is not death of romantic love -
                it's its aid.

                It's not fit for art, but married people have fought
                with something worse than dragons - time.
                Marriage is *aesthetic*.

                Ethical life requires development of the *self*.

                Choice. A's life is full of choice, but none of them
                are *significant* - he'snot commited.

                A's manner of saying "either/or" means loss of self.

                If we drift and fail to decisively take control of
                our life, we will lose our selves.

                When one chooses seriously, *engaging oneself*, one
                chooses *ethically*. The judge isn't urging A
                to choose *good* - just urging him to *choose*.

                The judge's either/or is about categories of
                evaluation. We will lead a radically different life
                if we decide according to "good/evil" (ethical), versus
                "interesting/boring" (esthetic).

                Do you choose with *ironic detachment*, or
                a *seriousness and passion of will*?
                The ethical person stops trying to *be* something,
                and starts a project of *becoming* something - a self.

                We are not *willing to be ourselves* - we always
                want to approach God or be an unthinking brute.

                Recognizing this tension is beyond the ethical.

                infinite, reflective side.
                This movement is very hard.

                Knight of Faith: resigns everything, sets himself
                adrift, takes refuge in his eternal side, but as he's
                infinitely resignating, he comes back into the world.
                Johannes can't understand where he finds the strength.

                Faith is something to be lived. And it's not something
                particularly otherworldly or ascetic.

                Not easy to recognize a knight of faith. It's not about what
                they do or how, but why.

                Faith is hard. It's a passion.

                Faith cannot be learned in a formula from someone. To aspire to
                go beyond faith (like some Hegelians) is to not understand life
                of knights of faith.

                Anti-Climacus ("super-christian" - Climacus is not a christian)
                writes *The Sickness unto Death* - exploring varieties
                of despair. Despair is our advantage over other animals, being
                in despair is the greatest misery.

                Despair is sickness in the self, leads to death of the self
                unless cured.

                Someone in despair despairs over *something* - so it
                seems *only for a moment*. In despairing over *something*,
                we really despair over *ourselves* and want to ***be
                rid of ourselves***.

                We are synthesis of what we (1) immediately, factually are,
                (2) the possibility of reflection and doing something about it.
                Being a self means, in addition, *relating these factors to
                each other*, bringing them into harmony.

                One can fail at being a self, that failure is despair:
                imbalance in the factors of synthesis that manifests in
                unwillingness to be ourselves.

                Infinitude's despair is finitude. Becoming fantastic. Loving
                all humanity, yet hating one's neighbor; etc.

                Finititude's despair lacks infinitude. Self without infinitude
                has no sharp edges, assumes only possibilities are "how things
                are done". This allows the self to be cheated of itself by
                "the others". Dares not to believe in oneself; gains all
                required for flawless performance in everyday life. Ground
                smooth as a pebble. Worldliness consists of people who pawn
                themselves to the world. Such people are perhaps mentioned in
                history, but are not themselves.

                Another form: being willing (in despair) to be oneself: despair
                of defiance. Don't want to don their own self, do not want to
                see their task in their given selves, but wants to construct it
                himself. The self wants to be its own god.

                Experimenting with self. There is nothing firm in this form.
                The self is not increasingly itself - it is increasingly
                obvious it's *hypothetically* itself. The self is its own
                master, and this is the despair, or can be regarded as its
                pleasure and joy. Yet this absolute ruler rules over nothing.
                The self is subject to dialectic that rebellion is legitimate
                at any moment. Despairing self keeps building castles on air.

                A logical system is possible. An *existential* one is not.

                Geometry: OK. All theorems are implicit in the premises -
                such systems are "final". Nothing relating to existence can be
                incorporated into logical systems. Existence is opposite of

                Quality of life depends on intensity, passion,
                decisiveness with which this relation is maintained.

                An objective uncertainty held fast in

                form. *Externalization* of ourselves makes us fully human.

                In industrial age, workers produce *commodities*.
                Their work is not an affirmation of themselves.

                Private property is *alienated labor*. Classical economists
                formulate laws of estranged labor, in society of dehumanized

                the plague.

                Workers are alienated both from their labor and its products
                (which belong to the capitalist). Workers just have wages,
                which are subsistence-level. They put their life into objects

                Bentham claims legislation and morality might be made scientific.
                Qualities are not so quantifiable.

                (We have to set aside feelings of moral obligation - since
                morality is something we're trying to decide in the first
                place!)

                In personal life, we can better know the particular things

        back: |
                Both Bentham and Mill address this.

                Bentham: consider the alternatives (in various versions and
                disguises).

                Principle of ascetism: judging many actions to be
                right that deny pleasure to them or others (e.g., Stoics,
                Luther beating himself for his sins).

                Counterarguments:

                1. Never applied consistently. A monk doesn't torture himself
                because it's good in itself, but because he judges it necessary
                for bliss. Stoics see that some pleasures result in pain,
                but they wrongly generalize that pleasures are never good.
                Nonetheless, they praise virtue, which (according to Bentham)
                produces pleasure without pains. So, Stoics reject utility
                inconsistently.

                2. Ascetism has never been applied to government. No politician
                ever aimed at making arsonists, housebreakers and bandits
                rulers. Govenment allows criticism of increased misery of
                populace.

                Principle of sympathy: approve or disapprove not on account
                of whether actions tend to happiness, but whether man finds
                himself disposed to approve or disapprove of them.

                This is not a principle, but a denial that a principle is
                needed. People often cloak their prejudices in fine words.
                God, good order, reason, etc. come down to whether
                the individual approves or disapproves.

                None of us can continue to call something *morally right*
                if we clearly imagine it ending in misery, for no further
                good.

                The only proof capable of being given is visible objects,

                so with other sources of experience.
                The only evidence that something is desirable is that people
                desire it.

                Problem: "Desirable" does not mean "can be desired", but
                "should be desired", so the fact that something *is* desired
                doesn't mean it *ought* to be desired.
                <li>
                Happiness is a good, each person's happiness is a good to that
                person, so general happiness is good to the aggregate of all
                persons.

                Problem: Doesn't follow that *your* happiness is a good
                for *me*.

                <ul>
                <li> Aiming at pleasure is aiming too low: Mill says we require
                more than pigs to be made happy: "It is better to be a human
                being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be
                a Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool,
                or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they
                only know their own side of the question."
                <li> Utilitarian standard is unrealizable, not everyone
                can be happy.
                Response: even it is impossible, the principle would still
                be valid. Second: it's an exaggeration to say that happiness
                - even the general happiness - is impossible.

                "When people who are tolerably fortunate in their outward lot
                do not find in life sufficient enjoyment to make it valuable
                to them, the cause generally is caring for nobody but
                themselves."

                And, Mill on how to achieve happiness (hedonistic paradox).
                <li>
                Doesn't utilitarianism undercut character, virtue?
                Shouldn't we admire people who sacrifice personal happiness?

                Response: Sacrifics for others is not good in itself - it is
                only admirable if it increases total happiness.
                <li>
                It is too demanding.

                Response: Ethics tells us what is right and wrong, but it
                doesn't go as far as saying everything should be done from
                a certain *motive* (note: differs from Kant, for whom
                etical actions are only from duty).

                Motivations don't matter for judgement of *actions*,
                through they may inform our estimates about the *agent*.
                <li>
                Utilitarianism renders men cold and calculating.

                Response: Utilitarianism does not forbid valuing character.
                In the long run, best proof of a good character is good
                actions.
                <li>
                Utilitarianism is godless, only counts worldly happiness.

                Response: Depends of how you think of God. If God wants
                happiness of all creatures and that's why he made them,
                then utility is not godless, but profoundly religious.
                <li>
                Principle of utility is impractical, we have to act quickly
                in making a choice.

                Response (Mill): That's the same as if you said we can't read
                the New and Old Testaments every time we decide.
                We are always learning by experience the tendencies of actions.
                Utility does not rule out common wisdom. Secondary rules may
                be gradually improved.

                Mill: Bentham's great value is in trying to improve subordinate
                principles - social institutions and law.

                can't be attained by making it a direct end. Happy people

                Can utilitarianism be the sole moral principle?
                Or must we incorporate justice, which resists calculation of
                consequences?

                (E.g., execute an innocent to prevent a riot.)

                Mill: Justice is a special case of utility.
                The subjective feeling from utility and justice is different,
                and stronger for justice, sure. Justice is associated with
                *rights* - *legal* rights and *moral* rights. (A person may
                have a moral right even in absence of legal protection.)
                Injustice leads to resentment, so we want to punish,
                particularly violations of moral rights.

                Rights are things I have a claim on society to protect.
                Well, what's the origin of rights? On what grounds does society
                owe me?

                Mill: There's no reason besides general utility, and none is
                needed.
                *Security* is very fundamental to happiness, so much to make
                it a right.

                *Justice* is, according to Mill, about moral rules that
                concern the essentials of human well-being.

                Mill: Why are woman subjugated?
        back: |
                By historical accident - women were always in subjugation.
                It was never rationally decided.
                It's *law of the strongest*.

                Why did this custom stay, when slavery and monarchy were
                abolished? Because the empowered class is the entire male
                sex, not a limited class.
                Women have strongest motivation to seek favour of men
                and avoiding to give them offence.

                Counterargument: Why don't women complain?

                Countercounterargument: (1) Some do. (2) The pattern is that
                those subjected to power of an ancient origin begin
                by complaining about its abuse, not about the power; there's
                plenty of complaints from woman with husbands who abuse them.
                (3) Men don't want just obedience, they also want sentiment
                (willing slaves). They enslave women's *minds* - not just
                on *fear*. The entire force of education indoctrinates women.

                Popular books: "women exist for the sake of men".
                Ask boys: "to what purpose are you talking?", ask girls:
                "how will your discourse be received?"
                Women should never say anything disagreeable.

                (1) Morality is undermined in the female world by putting
                on a show, not on the substance. Virtue and its shadow are at
                variance.

                (2) Women are persuaded to value trivialities - attractiveness,
                decorum. They are turned towards sensuality and away from
                understanding. "A virtuous woman" has sexual connotations,
                "a virtuous man" has none - "women are, foremost, pleasers!!"

                (3) Everything is focused on how a woman is *regarded*.
                Attention is focused on only one virtue: chastity.
                If the honour of a woman is safe, she may ruin her family
                by gaming and extravagance, yet still present a shameless
                front.

                (4) They are *weakened* by their existence being justifiable
                only in terms of relations to another. And they are *brought
                up to be weak*.
                Submisiveness, meekness, resignation were an essential part
                of sexual attractiveness.

                (5) Women become *cunning by necessity*. They can't have money
                or property, so they arise jealousy, etc.
                Understanding has been denied to women; instinct was sublimated
                into wit and cunning and substituted.
                Also, *meddlesomeness*.

                (6) Men who are considerate of their wives' opinions are
                often made worse, not better, by their influence. Women seldom
                have hones and conscientious opinions.
                Women know what will bring money/invitations/good marriages
                to kids, but not what is right in politics.
                Women lack straightforward rationality, so they govern their
                husband indirectly, sneakily.

                The Birth of Tragedy.

                Argued that Greeks used tragedy to solve the problem
                of "value of existence", with a plea for the relevance of
                that solution today.

                Nietzsche: Our perceptions of Greeks as "nobly simple, grandiose,
                calm, measured, harmonious, beautiful" do not fit tragedy
                (in particular, our knowledge of its origins).

                Greeks looked into the abyss of human suffering without
                blinking - they experienced it and didn't look away.

                Quote: "What is best for you is *not to be born*, not to *be*,
                to be *nothing*; but the second best for you is &mdash;

        front: How did Greeks find a way to live and rejoice?
        back: |
                (1) Tragedies often performed at religious festivals.
                These were serious business.

                (2) Writing plays was a competition, prizes were given for the
                best plays and playwrights were challenged.

                Nietzsche: For Greeks, everything was a contest - envy,
                ambition, etc. is everywhere in their life.
                Greek ethos: competitive spirit is *affirmed*, not *condemned*.

                (3) Tragedies unite 2 opposing forces of life:
                Apollo and Dionysus. Apollo: order and measure, restraint
                ("Know thyself.").

                Apollo: this is the right sort of gods to have, these
                gods live like humans, but splendidly. (Nothing suggests
                ascetism, spirituality, duty.)

                Greeks created the gods from a profound need. First: Titanic
                order of terror, then: Olympian divine order of joy,
                then: Apollonian impulse to beauty. (progression)
                This is how they endured the suffering of existence.
                Their gods justify the life of man.

                In tragedies, suffering is not withdrawn - it's presented,
                explored, given weight. It can't be explained as a way to escape.

                Bacchus (or Dionysus): god of wine, excess, loss of control.
                Conventions left. Dionysian notes in lyric poetry, folk song.
                Desire, hate, envy, etc. expressed without reserve.

                Tragedy happens when Dionysus meets Apollo.

                Nietzsche accepts Schopenhauser's metaphysics, through not
                his evaluation of it. The world of experience is merely
                appearance; the thing that *appears* in appearance is just
                *will* made manifest. The world is endless striving, wanting,
                desiring. As Kant taught, causality, space, time (principles
                that *individuate* things) only apply to phenomena, not to
                noumena (things in themselves) - so these principles don't
                apply to *will*.

                Realm of individuated phenomena: Apollo (measure, order,
                knowledge, morality), raging depths of urgent reality:
                Dionysus (intoxication breaks down distinctions and rules).
                Apollo governs the world of appearance, Dionysis expresses
                the will.

                Role of the *chorus*: a chorus often speaks/chants in unison.
                Interpretations: an ideal spectators, political commentary
                (citizens commenting on actions of royalty). Nietzsche believes:

                1. Greek drama had no roles for individual actors - there was *only* the chorus.

                2. The chorus were *satyrs*, half-human half-goat companions of Dionysus.

                Tragedy is *religious* and *redeems*, and we can be *saved*
                through it.

                Why was chorus made from satyrs?
                It's offspring of longing for the primitive and natural,
                yet not a mere ape - the archetype of man, embodiment
                of highest and most intense emotions.
                Satyrs were sublime and divine.

                Spectators identified with the satyr chorus. (i.e., "audience
                at rock concerts")
                Dionysian music originated in the primordial reality -
                the *will* - from which derives all the apparent world,
                including the spectators.

                The drama is a *dream of the chorus*. The Dionysian chorus
                dreams an Apollinian dream, spectators dream it too.

                Experiencing a tragic drama is like dreaming, when a dreamer
                says to oneself "It's a dream! I will dream on!"

                How tragedies solve the problem of existence:
                In them, *individuals are destroyed*. It's a window into
                reality. Given Schopenhauer's metaphysics, our lives are
                *merely appearance* and not reality, we are a dream
                of the will. Reality is in Dionysian depths with no
                individuation of space, time, causality.
                The chorus *affirms* the dream, including the suffering
                and destruction, and *so the spectators come to affirm life*.
                Passionately, joyously. They know they are infinitely more than
                petty individualities of the apparent world. They experience
                fusion with the root of the world, and willing the creation
                of the drama and of their lives.

                The metaphysical comfort: at the bottom of things, despite
                the changes in appearances, life is indestructibly powerful
                and pleasurable.

                Art saves Greeks from the Buddistic negation of the will.

                Tragedy exclaims: "We believe in eternal life"

                There are 2 kinds of pessimism: pessimism of weakness and
                of strength. Weakness: Schopenhauer - wants just Buddhist
                relief from life. Strength: Greeks - joyous affirmation in the
                face of the terror.

                Our lives may turn out tragic, but there's nothing else that
                can give life meaning and solve the problem of the value
                of existence.

                What makes our life worth living is *not* anything moral, *not*
                another life, *not* our relation to God - just its *aesthetic
                value*. We are just "images and artistic projections for
                the true author" - the primordial unity, the will, the
                Dionysian power. This can overcome pessimism.
                We can accept our lives even if our eyes are wide open
                to its terrors. This is the *only* way the problem could
                be solved.

        back: |
                Every great philosophy so far was a personal confession of the
                author and a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir;
                if we want to explain how weird metaphysical claims came about,
                we should first ask: at which morality does the philosopher
                aim?

                Philosophy is about *psychology*. Philosophers believe they
                talk about ultimate reality, but at the bottom, there's always
                some "hunch", or an "inspiration" - more often a **desire**
                that has been filtered and made abstract, and then
                rationalized.

                Applies to "God", "soul", "free will", "the 'true' world",
                "morality", "cause", "substance", etc.
                He senses dishonesty, or even lying. (Suspicion shared
                with Kierkegaard.)
                Philosophy is this tyrannical drive itself, the most spiritual
                will to power, to the "creation of the world".

                Grounded in language we speak or in our human nature.

                Our intellect produced some errors, which happen to be useful

                are things, substances, bodies; that our will is free;
                that what is good for me is good in itself.

                Kant's categories are also errors.

                The concept of *substance* is indispensable for logic,
                althrough nothing real corresponds to it.
                Same with *cause and effect*.

                Ancestors who had skeptical tendencies were in danger for life.

                Difference from Kant:
                (1) These concepts do *not* apply correctly to the phenomenal
                world.
                (2) There is no noumenal world of things-in-themselves that
                these concepts fall short of.
                They are just a pure necessity, we couldn't survive without

                them!

                These people felt *themselves* as determining values!
                The value judgements presupposed powerful physique, flourishing
                health, adventure, dances, war games, etc.

                The morality of conquerors is held in check by custom, respect,
                gratitude, their relations to each other. With strangers, they
                savor a freedom from all social constraints.

                Categories: good/evil.
                Different psychological dynamics: "evil" is a primary concept
                and is driven not by affirmation, but by negation
                (not a "yes" to life, but "no").

                Slaves are by definition powerless to the nobles, who call
                themselves "the good".
                Slave revolt in morality begins when *resentment itself
                becomes creative and gives rise to values*.

                Slave morality says "no" to the different, to the outside, to
                what is not itself.
                **In order to exist, slave morality first needs a hostile
                external world. Its action is fundamentally reaction.**

                The *evil* of slave morality is the *good* of the master
                morality, seen by *resentment*.

                For slaves, the *good* would be like them: poor, weak, humble,
                serving. "Good" is absence of "evil" - resistance to
                domineering arrogance of nobles.

                We want to be comfortable, easily satisfied, without pain
                and suffering - "happy". And we think everyone has a
                right for this.

                Zarathustra compares preachers of equality to tarantulas:

                Reverenge sits in your souls. Your poison makes the soul
                whirl with reverenge.
                Behind "equality" and "justice for all" there is hatred,
                reverenge, resentment, spite. We have to see that our
                values are based on lies.

                The "virtues" of slave morality are things slaves *cannot help*
                but do. The weak, however, interpret them as something

                The weak can only take credit for their "virtues"
                if they postulate a free will. That's also how they blame
                the strong for their "crimes".

                Doctrine of free will was invented to *punish* - to *impute

                *guilty* and be *judged and punished*. The origin of every
                act had to lie in consciousness.

                But consciousness is *too superficial* to contain the
                causes for actions, which actually lie in physiological
                condition of the body.

                The overman is the *meaning of the earth*. You and I cannot

                Overman will remain faithful to Earth and not hanker for

                and sickness and weariness with life.

                Overman will be health, tough, etc.

                (1) Starts as a camel -- seeks out what is most difficult
                and loads it on his bck. Discipline, obedience, bearing
                heavy burdens is part of his training. A spirit that would
                attain great heights cannot *begin* there. Analogue with
                Nietzsche's philology: everyone has to start with Plato,
                Aristotle and Kant.

                (2) In loneliest desert, becomes a lion: would conquer his freedom
                and be master in his own desert. Wants to fight the great
                dragon, named "You shalt". The spirit of the lion says
                "I will". The lion says "No!" to all "you shalt"'s and opens
                a space for freedom, to create new values.

                (3) Hence, he becomes a child. The child is innocence, forgetting,
                a new beginning. A sacred "Yes" to the game of creation -
                of values.

                Not heedlessly. His values are expressions of who he is.

                *We want to become who we are* - human beings who create
                themselves.

                To become who one is, one must not have the faintest notion
                of *what* one is. Consciousness - its surface - must be kept
                clear of all great imperatives. Beware every great word,
                every great pose!

                He first trains all *subservient* capacities before giving
                any hint of the dominant "aim", "task" or "meaning".

                Overman does not lie back and wait to unfold.
                He must be *hard*. Demands much, most of all from himself.

                The overman is the poet of his life, both creates the work

                Life is what must always overcome itself.
                Whatever I create, I must soon oppose it - thus the will wills
                it. Will to power is not the *conscious* will; it is the
                intention to which we normally ascribe action. Will to power
                is *life itself* climbing over itself.
                It's not Schopenhauer's will - it's a characterisation of our
                life in *this* world.
                Even knowledge is driven by desire, interest, will. (We should
                add perspectives to gain *height* from which an overman
                can survey the truth.)

                Will to power motivates the slave rebellion in morality.

                Overman is what life - all life - is drives toward.
                Life of an overman is beyond reverenge and without resentment.
                No blaming, no accusations, no complaining, no victim-think.
                No self-pity. *No pity at all.*
                An overman is strong enough for pain, struggles, suffering.
                More to the point, he's *grateful* for it.

                Exploitation is essential to life.
                Aristocracy of overmen will, *of course*, exploit those

                He is conscious of the "order of rank".

                <ul>

                graciousness on earth

                <b>Authority:</b>
                Create an institution that will keep correct doctrines and
                perpetuate them, and prevent contrary doctrines from being
                taught. Terrify anyone who would reject the established belief.

                It is superior, and for the mass of humankind, no better
                method may exist.

                It's also unstable: some people will see that other doctrines
                have been held in other times or places. (But - doesn't draw
                the conclusion that custom is king of all.)
                <li>
                <b>A priori method / method of natural preferences:</b>
                Accept what seems *obvious*, or maybe *clear and distinct*.
                Our opinions are those we arrive at through reflection,
                conversation, thought.

                Plato ... Hegel's metaphysical methods are examples.

                Still unsatisfactory: what's obvious for one is not obvious
                for another; pendulum between material and spiritual philosophy
                <li>
                <b>Method of science:</b>
                What we need: some method by which beliefs are determined
                by nothing human, but by something upon which our thinking
                has no effect - something eternal.
                The ultimate conclusion of every man must be the same.

                Fundamental hypothesis: there are Real things, whose characters
                are entirely independent of our opinions about them; those
                Reals affect our senses according to regular laws, and, through
                our sensations are as different as our relations to
                the objects, we can still ascertain by reasoning and perception
                how things really and truly are, and anyone with sufficient
                experience and reason will come to the same conclusions.

        back: |
                Belief and doubt are different sensations.

                We're strongly disposed to escape doubt, but we're content
                when we have a belief.

                Belief is a *habit*, doubt is the lack of such a habit.
                Belief is *not a momentary mode of consciousness*.
                It also doesn't make us act, but when a condition arises,
                we do something.
                Doubting is the lack of a settled habit, it is essentially
                anxious and irritating.

                <ul>
                <li>
                <b>Stimulus - doubt.</b>
                Inquiry always begins with a felt problem.
                (But - not the mere putting of propositions into interrogative
                form does not provide a stimulus. There must be a *real*,
                *living* doubt - vs Descartes)
                Descartes's doubt is just "make-believe". This "initial
                skepticism" is just self-deception, not real doubt - we still
                carry all our prejudices. Cartesian doubt actually leads to
                recovering the beliefs we held before!

                What we need is **NOT** an absolutely certain starting point,
                but a *method* of improving beliefs that, to begin with,
                we don't imagine *can* be doubted.

                <b>End - settlement of opinion</b>

                Isn't this aiming too low? Shouldn't we want to get *truth*?

        front: View on truth
        back: |
                Truth/falsity are definable in terms of doubt, belief,
                the course of experience. If you try to use them to refer
                to something external, you know nothing about these entities,
                Ockham's razor shaves them off.

                What motivates our doubt is the worry that they might not
                *correspond* with reality, but if that's what we mean, then
                we are taking of entities of whose existence we know nothing.

                We do not and cannot stabilize our beliefs by noticing
                that they are true (i.e., that they correspond to fact).

                There is also no *unmediated knowledge* - no theory-free
                apprehension of "the facts". We can never get a *pure
                conception* of a fact, uncontaminated by previous cognitions.

                Through everything we see is a phenomenal manifestation of
                ourselves, it also is a phenomenon of something without
                us - like a rainbow involves rain and the sun.

                Truth is *unassailable belief*, or belief we would tend to
                if belief were to tend to absolute fixity.
                It is defined *not by the individual, but by the community
                of inquirers*.

                Beliefs, being habits, invariably lead to conduct in
                conjunction with desires that move us to act.
                Belief "that is a hamburger" is true if I can eat it;
                it's false if biting it reveals rubber and does not satisfy
                my desire to eat.

                That whose characters are independent of what anybody may
                think them to be.
                (Not a perfectly correct definition, but a very helpful one.)

                Alternatively: Opinion that will be ultimately agreed on by all
                investigators. Object represented in truth is the real.

                Reality is independent - not necessarily of thought in general,
                only of what I or any finite number of men think about it.

                *Science* is the *criterion of the real* (the ideal science
                towards which scientific activity is moving).

                We *can* actually know things as they really are. There is no
                hidden *thing-in-itself*.
