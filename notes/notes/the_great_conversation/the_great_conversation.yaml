                        obzvlášť hezkou dívku.
                        Pohádali se, Achilles se vrátil do stanu a odmítal dál
                        bojovat.

                        Anaximander předpokládá balanci, která musí být
                        navrácena, ať převážil kterýkoli element.
                        Je to extenze Homerova vidění (který vykresloval balanci
                        emocí - hněv, pýcha vedou k boží odplatě).
                        Tento princip podle Anaximandra platí i všude ve světě,
                        nejen mezi lidmi.
                        Tento princip taky není od bohů, ale od světa samotného.
                        Takhle podle Anaximandra svět prostě funguje - to je
                        odpojení od Homéra (s Thaletem).

                        Sees all over, thinks all over, hears all over.
                        Remains in one place.
                        Without toil, he sets all things in motion by
                        the thought of his mind.

                        To think at all is to think that something *is*.
                        It's impossible to think of "nothing".

                        the he wouldn't pay until he won his first case.
                        He didn't enter any cases for some time.
                        Protagoras eventually brought him to court, prosecuting
                        him for payment.
                        <br>
                        The student argued:
                        <br>
                        If I win, I shall not have to pay (according to the
                        judgement of the court). If I lose, I will not have
                        won my first case, so I will not have to pay.
                        So I don't have to pay.
                        <br>
                        Protagoras:
                        <br>
                        If he loses this case, then by the judgement he will
                        have to pay me. If he wins it, he will have won his
                        first case and therefore he will have to pay me.
                        So he has to pay.

                        Didn't claim to know what it is.
                        Tried to clarify it: whether it can be taught,
                        whether it's one thing or many, etc.

                        since it didn't intrigue him. Interested in i.e.,

                        He is convinced there is a truth
                        and that we can make our opinions more like it.

                        <br>
                        The source of unhappiness is a lack of harmony in
                        soul. Reason makes the decisions, supported by spirit,
                        desire is channeled appropriately.
                        <br><br>
                        Justice happens when people are in harmony.
                        Soul is happy when it is in harmony, hence "just".
                        We have *social justice* and *internal personal justice*.
                        Plato needs to show that *social justice* is good
                        for the individual.
                        *Internal justice*, it has been shown, is good for itself.
                        <br>
                        To be unjust is to allow the "internal beast" to rule
                        and overwhelm "the man within".
                        To be good is to be just,
                        so the Form of Justice takes us to the Form of the Good.

                        him to turn the rudder "navigators",
                        or that they "know ships".

                        the sea, etc.
                        They think navigation is not teachable,
                        and nothing can enable one to steer the ship better.

                              never defines this. Just a "poetic metaphor".

                             *being individual realities* are in conflict.
                             If Forms are individual substances, it makes no
                             sense to think of them as shared among substances.
                             If they are universal (non-individual), there is
                             no sense in thinking of them as things existing

                             Forms just add "self" to sensible terms.

                        Most natural function of living beings is reproduction,
                        so they may share in eternity and divinity.<br><br>

                        What persists cannot be numerically the same (because
                        it's not possible to participate
                        both in eternity and divinity), so the species
                        reproduces.

                        2 answers to whether souls exist independently on
                        bodies
                back: >
                        Soul doesn't feel pity, learns or thinks - a man does.
                        Sometimes those penetrate to soul.
                        <br>
                        Sensation starts from particular objects;
                        recollection starts from the soul.
                        Sensation cannot occur without a body. Recollections
                        have bodily effects (e.g., running to catch a bus).
                        A person is *one being* with *one essence*.
                        <br><br>
                        Soul is a *substance*, inasmuch as it is the form of
                        a natural body that potentially possesses life.
                        A soul is a form for a *primary substance*.
                        If the eye were an animal, its soul would be sight.
                        <br><br>
                        His account is for *souls in general* and for *rational souls*.

                         (2) we feel fear and anger without choice,
                         but virtues are a kind of choice (or aren't possible
                         without choice). We can't be good *naturally*.
                         <li> <i>Not innate</i>: through we have a capacity

                         until they become habitual. *Can be taught.*

                         they are possibly independent. Often,
                         brave men are not moderate. In perfection, you
                         can't have one virtue without having all.

                        On the mean - of emotions, etc. We should have
                        *right* amount of fear, for example - not too much

                        Right amount depends on *circumstances*

                        may not be courageous for another.
                        This is an *objective* relativity.
                        <br><br>
                        Role of reason is *finding this mean*, the right amount.
                        That is *practical sense* or *practical wisdom*.

                        If we shouldn't care if we get our preferences
                        frustrated,
                        why not lay down and not eat when hungry?
                back: >
                        It's okay and natural to eat when hungry, it's our
                        nature (see: pantheism). Same with seeking wisdom,
                        wealth, etc.; the error is in attributing
                        *absolute value* to these things.

                        Lawyer asks "Who is my neighbour?"
                        <br><br>
                        A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
                        and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat
                        him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
                        Now by chance a priest was going down that road;
                        and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.
                        So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place
                        and saw him, passed by on the other side.
                        But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he
                        was; and when he saw him, he had compassion,
                        and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on
                        oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast
                        and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
                        And the next day he took out two denarii and gave
                        them to the innkeeper, saying: "Take care of him;
                        and whatever more you spend, I will repay you
                        when I come back". Which of these three, do you think,
                        proved neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?
                        <br><br>

                        thing which was in me but was not part of me.
                        The truth, of course, was that it was all my own self,
                        my own impiety that divided me against myself.
                        My sin was all that more incurable because I did not
                        think myself a sinner"

                        Saint Paul said that Word is one with God and
                        enlightens everyone, so nobody lacks truth
                        entirely.

                back: >
                        We cannot recognize truth just by being told it,
                        words are at most *signs*. They represent some reality.
                        Some words signify other signs ("noun"),
                        some signify realities ("horse").
                        Knowledge may be expressed as signs, but not necessarily.
                        We do not learn from words - we must understand.
                        Words are at best reminders.
                        We don't consult a speaker, but the truth he has within.
                        Christ is who teaches, inside all of us. Every rational
                        minds consults him. Everyone receives as much as he
                        can because of his own good or bad will.
                        The inner light is like the light of the Sun.
                        God is, God is apprehended and God causes other
                        things to be apprehended.
                        Noone ever teaches another person anything.
                        For Augustine, we learn by contronting realities,
                        illuminated by the Interion Teacher: Christ.

                        Plotinus was familiar with mystical experience.
                        Multiplicity of things disappears.
                        Identity of the self with "the All", "the One",
                        "God"; untroubled bliss.
                        <br><br>
                        He talks about this reality as **the One**.
                        <br><br>
                        We can say nothing about *the One*, since
                        it would imply some multiplicity in it. It's "ineffable".
                        It's majesty *beyond being*. "Unity" / "the Transcendent"
                        / "the Good", "the Source".
                        <br><br>
                        The One is the source of whatever else exists.
                        It makes all things possible. Not a plurality,
                        but a source of plurality.
                        <br><br>
                        There are Many because the One is ungrudging in giving.
                        <br><br>
                        **Great Chain of Being**: reality partitioned
                        in graded steps, between the One and vanishingly
                        small realities.

                        Since Parmenides, what *is not* does not exist.
                        The good things are reality.
                        <br><br>
                        Because things lack some qualities doesn't make them
                        evil.
                        By necessity, not everything can be perfect
                        (like God is).
                        <br><br>
                        Evil can exist only where there is good. Nothing
                        is evil per se.

                        God is not located in time at all.

                        The present is only an infinitesimal instant.
                        When time is present, it has no duration -
                        the knife edge between *what is not yet* and
                        *what is no longer*.
                        <br><br>
                        If we speak accurately, memory is *present of things
                        past*, direct awareness is *present of things
                        present*, expectation is *present of things future*.
                        These times all exist in the mind.
                        <br><br>
                        Time has no meaning apart from the mind,
                        so it *must* have come into being along with creation.
                        Minds are not eternal. In posession expectation,
                        attention and memory, minds are where time realizes
                        itself. As such, they are a faint image of God,
                        who also sees past, present and future.
                        God, unlike us, lives in a "never-ending present" -
                        he knows all time at once.

                        *consent* to that tendency. To be afraid is to
                        *disagree* - an act of will.
                        Similar with joy and grief.

                        Will is **free**.
                        In sin, soul consents to be body's slave.

                        Will is itself a good thing. (All created things are
                        good; also, without will, no one can live rightly.)
                        <br><br>
                        Free will: an *intermediate good*. Whether it
                        leads to happiness is up to us.
                        <br><br>
                        Will commits sin when it turns away from
                        immutable and common goods towards its private good.
                        Thus man becomes proud, meddlesome and lustful.

                back: >
                        Pride is the root of sin.
                        "God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will
                        be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good
                        and evil." They wanted to be "like God".
                        <br><br>
                        The original sin: man regards himself as his own
                        light, and turns away from that light which would
                        make man himself a light if he would
                        set his heart on it.
                        <br><br>
                        There is no efficient cause of an evil choice.
                        It's not a matter of efficiency, but of deficiency.
                        <br>
                        If there were a cause for evil, it would - since it
                        is - be good. The cause for sin is that incomplete
                        being of the will is a *necessary condition* for sin.
                        If sin had an efficient cause, it would not
                        be subject to punishment.

                        We actually owe him greatest thanks. But then, did

                        on the presence of "inducements/invitations".
                        Choosing those is our act of free will.

                        For Augustine: we *receive* wisdom. We must be humble
                        before God (because we are too limited to discover
                        truth on our own).

                        For Greeks, human problems and solutions are about
                        ignorance andknowledge.
                        Augustine: intellect may be impotent, or worse, until
                        the will is straightened out. What is needed
                        is not (at first) education, but *conversion*.

                        Suppose that that, than which no greater can be conceived,
                        only exists in understanding and not in reality.

                        But then it's not *that, than which no greater can be
                        conceived*. We can conceive of something greater:
                        that exists in both understanding and reality.

                        It claims that the existence of God is *self-evident*
                        and moves from his *essence* to his *existence*.

                        cause - God.
                        It the series were infinite, there would be
                        no cause which is "first", so there would be no
                        intermediate causes and no ultimate causes.

                        could anything have begun to exist? So, there must
                        exist something that exists necessarily. By chain
                        (similar to Efficient Causality/Motion),

                        own necessity, and causing in others their

                        wise, good.
                        <br><br>
                        The meaning of "wise" (etc.) is derived from
                        experience with human/animal wisdom, not from

                        <br><br>
                        Blood, food, etc is called "healthly" because
                        of its relation with healthy people (who are
                        actually healthy). Same with God. The words we
                        use express God's substance imperfectly just as
                        creatures (having any perfection) represent
                        him imperfectly.
                        <br><br>
                        "God is good" doesn't mean either "God causes
                        goodness" or "God is not bad", but "What we call
                        goodness in creatures pre-existat in a higher
                        way in God".
                        <br><br>
                        The words "wise", "good" etc. are learned by
                        application to creatures. Creatures are good
                        because God creates goodness. For creatures,
                        "good" is an extra attribute.

                        Makes us tenacious in pursuing what our reason
                        determines to be truly good, so we don't give

                        rather than reckless.

                        As Aristotle said, contemplation would be the most satisfying
                        activity for us (activity of soul, according to reason,
                        over an entire lifetime).
                        But that's not possible in this world.

                        We want total immersion in absolute goodness forever.
                        Philosophy can point at God's grace, but cannot supply
                        it.

                back: >
                        Ordinarily, an "intuitive cognition" of a tangerine
                        is caused by there being a tangerine and some things
                        about us (e.g., not being on drugs).

                        Could God cause the experience without the mediation
                        of the actual fruit?

                        Yes, it wouldn't be self-contradictory.

                        So, since knowledge must come from *certainty*,
                        we can't be certain that there actually is a tangerine
                        if we perceive one.

                        So with causation: what if fire doesn't cause cloth
                        to burn, but God always intervenes?

                        Maybe reason and theology are incompatible!

                        Look at "first mover":
                        <ul>
                        <li> It is not evident that anything is moved.
                             Movement is only apparent.
                        <li> How do we know movement comes from some other
                             object?
                        <li> Okay, say there's a first mover.
                             What if the first mover is unmoved for the present,
                             but not absolutely unmovable?
                        <li> What if there's a circularity of cause and effect?
                        <li> What if God in His absolute power created
                             an infinite series of essentially ordered causes?
                        <li> etc etc etc.

                        The sky is a thing (a dome).

                        and Moon: lighter elements (air, fire).
                        All elements suffer constant change, mixing.
                        Change comes from motion of heavens. Outermost
                        spheres rotate very fast (to come to the same
                        position in 24 hours). Inner spheres are drawn
                        by friction. The spheres move because they have
                        desire to be united with Heaven.

                        There, Virgil will be supplanted, since he can't
                        enter paradise. These visions should resolve
                        Dante's crisis.

                        Bishop of 2 districts, aspired to be Archbishop
                        of Mainz, which would make him Germany's top cleric.
                        Pope damanded 10 000 ducats. His parishes couldn't
                        supply the fee, so he paid it himself,
                        borrowing the money at 20% interest from banking
                        house of Fugger. Agreed that "indulgences" would
                        be sold in his territories; half the income
                        he could use to repay the loan, half sent to Rome
                        to help build Saint Peter's Cathedral.

                        He was troubled by his sins and in terror of God's
                        justice. He couldn't be sure his motivations were pure.
                        He was never confient he searched out every
                        tinge of selfishness, greed, lust, pride.
                        Agonies of doubt, self-accusation.

                        He became a professor of theology.
                        Wrestled with text of Psalms, letters of Saint Paul.
                        Found out that the only thing needed was belief
                        in Jesus Christ to win forgiveness for sinners
                        such as himself. Salvation doesn't have to be *earned*!
                        It's a *gift*.

                        Church supports it, but that doesn't make it *right*.
                        Church often flatly disagrees with Scripture.
                        Only a *divine authority* can support indulgences.
                        And there is none: Neither Christ nor those
                        who knew him supported it.

                        Topic: Apology for Raymond Sebond
                back: >
                        Sebond was a 15th century theologien,
                        who claimed that not only can God's existence
                        be proven by reason (as Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas),
                        but *all* doctrines of Christianity can.

                        Montaigne translated Sebond's book into French
                        at his father's requests.
                        He set out to defend Sebond's thesis
                        ("apology" is "defense", as with Socrates).

                        Montaigne's strategy:
                        <ul>
                        <li> Assert than Christianity depends entirely on
                             faith
                        <li> Demonstrate extensively that Sebond's proofs
                             can be used to demonstrate anything at all.
                             His arguments will be as solid and firm
                             as any others of the same type that may
                             be opposed by them.
                        <li> Therefore, arguments for those are as good
                             as arguments against.
                        </ul>

                        Montaigne wonders: are we superior to animals at all?
                        Who are we to know?
                        We also obviously can't trust our senses.
                        We are often deceived by reason.
                        Science progresses and theories are always overthrown
                        later.
                        It's difficult or impossible to know the truth
                        about the universe.

                        Other creatures may have natural laws, but they
                        are lost in us. Human reason "butts in everywhere",
                        confusing things with vanity and inconsistency.
                        Truth about right and wrong is unavailable to us.
                        (Similar to Pico, but this is *despair*, not glory.)

                        When we try to justify something, we always go
                        in circles or in infinite regress.
                        Nothing can be established about anything.
                        Our senses may not even correspond at all to
                        external realities. We can't even find out whether
                        they do or don't.

                        *Skepticism is used as a defence of the status quo.*
                        Montaigne was brought up a Catholic. The sensible
                        thing is to stay in the customs we grew up in.

                        What Copernicus keeps and doesn't keep

                        Ptolemaic epicycles not entirely abolished.
                        Retains notion that celestial bodies move in circles;
                        notion of celestial spheres is still important.
                        Accepts that the universe is finite, through much
                        larger than thought before.
                        The sun is also not *clearly* in the center
                        (as most popular accounts of his views state).

                        Problem that Copernicus cracked,
                        his solution
                back: >
                        Apparently irregular movement of planets:
                        they appear to move slowly eastward against
                        fixed stars, then reverse course and go west.

                        Solution: the movement is only apparent,
                        the cause is actual movement of observers on Earth.

                        His solution is only a little bit more accurate,
                        and not much less complex than the Ptolemaic view.
                        It's more "harmonic", through.

                        Each thing as far as in it lies, continues always

                        continues to move.

                        All motion is of itself in a straight line.
                        Things which move in circles tend to recede from

                        The world is a *secular* world.
                        Dante is now like a fairy-tale, or at best
                        a moral allegory with no literal truth.

                        3 problems with Descartes's views
                back: >
                        <ul>
                        <li> Place of humans in the world of nature.:
                                Are we just cogs in a machine? Is there
                                room for purposes in this world? We assume
                                that we have free will, but is that just
                                an illusion?

                                Descartes approaches this by radically
                                splitting mind and body.

                                We aren't automata, because we have language,
                                and we are more flexible and adaptable
                                than any machine.
                        <li> The Mind and the Body.
                                Descartes claims mind and body are separate,
                                yet we are a unity. How can we be at the same
                                time two and one?
                        <li> God and the problem of skepticism.
                                If God is a deceiver or doesn't exist,
                                we have a big problem.

                        Substances: many simple ideas that often go together
                        ("lizard"); we can't imagine them subsisting alone,

                        and we call that "substratum".
                        Substances have "powers" (e.g., magnets and iron
                        shavings, gold produces an idea in our minds).

                        Sensation lets us frame material substances.
                        Reflection lets us frame *mental substances*.
                        We have the *complex idea of an immaterial spirit*.
                        Those cannot be just actions of bare insensible
                        matter. Locke agrees with Descartes's dualism.
                        (Though Locke doesn't think it's *possible*
                        to demonstate thinking cannot happen in material
                        substances.)

                        simple ideas we have from sensation and reflection,
                        and dive further into the nature of things, we fall

                        Does a mature me have the same soul as me as a child?
                        Does one person have one soul?

                        What actually gives me the idea of *myself* at all
                        is consciousness.
                        Our identity reaches as far back as our consciousness
                        does. We remember past experiences of our past selves.
                        Personal identity isn't sameness of substance,
                        including sameness of *soul* substance.

                        Locke thinks it's "probable" that one soul is attached
                        to one consciousness.

                        to gain worldly power.
                        So, civil power is obligated to tolerate differences
                        in which men seek to relate to God. The care of every
                        man's soul belongs unto himself.

                        Counterargument: Religious dissenters were
                        historically dangerous to civil order.
                        Counter-counterargument: That was the case only
                        because they were discriminated against.

                        (a) The objects of knowledge are our *ideas*.

                        (b) Our ideas (in case of primary qualities)
                        only *resemble* the qualities the material substance
                        really has.

                        (c) Substance is a *substratum* lying under those
                        primary qualities and producing those ideas in us.

                        (d) The true nature of substance is unknowable.

                        This adds up to skepticism.

                        Abuse of language.

                        Locke:
                        We have universal words, and general words function
                        as *names* for abstract ideas.
                        "Tiger" means "what is common to all tigers", neither
                        small nor large tiger, not male or female.

                        Berkeley: This is nonsense. The mind *doesn't have
                        a power of framing abstract ideas or notions
                        of things*.
                        The idea of "man": would have *some* color, but at
                        the same time *no color in particular*. Same with
                        stature.

                        We don't actually have an *idea* of existence
                        (of *nothing in particular*), same with *substance*,
                        *motion*, *solidity*, etc.

                        We may have *general* ideas, but not **abstract**
                        general ideas.

                        Their generality is not in their intrinsic nature,
                        but in how we use them.

                        Every word and every idea is particular.

                        "Tiger" has universal significance not because it
                        stands for an abstract idea (there is none),
                        but because those letters and sounds refer
                        to any tiger.
                        Thinking that such words are *names* is an
                        abuse of language.

                        Things, which are in their nature particular,
                        are rendered universal by relations.

                back: >
                        1. Even where words are names that stand for ideas,
                        it is not necessary that the ideas be brought to mind
                        on every occasion. Example: algebra and unknown
                        values.

                        2. Language has other functions beside communicating
                        ideas (e.g., exciting or deterring action,
                        etc.)

                        Author: "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his
                        self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability
                        to use one's understanding without guidance from
                        another. This immaturity is self-imposed when its
                        cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack
                        of resolve and courage to use it without guidance
                        from another. Sapere Aude! &laquo;Have courage

                        rather from the fruitless efforts of human vanity,
                        which would penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible
                        to understanding, or from the craft of popular
                        superstitions, which, being unable to defend themselves
                        on fair ground, raise these entangling brambles to cover
                        and protect their weakness. Chased from the open
                        country, these robbers fly into the forest, and lie
                        in wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of the
                        mind, and overwhelm it with religious fears and
                        prejudices.The stoutest antagonist, if he remit his watch
                        a moment, is oppressed. And many, through cowardice
                        and folly, open the gates to the enemies, and willingly
                        receive them with reverence and submission, as their
                        legal sovereigns.

                        But is this sufficient reason, why philosophers should
                        desist from such researches, and leave superstition
                        still in possession of her retreat? Is it not proper
                        to draw an opposite conclusion, and perceive the
                        necessity of carrying the war into the most secret

                        Descartes was right to be skeptical, but his idea
                        of a spiritual substance was just a hypothesis.
                        On the other hand, Hobbes's idea that mind is
                        mechanical was also a hypothesis.
                        We don't have insight into the actual "essence"
                        of human bodies or minds.

                        This *duplicity* does hold for all *simple* ideas,
                        but not all complex ideas (e.g., unicorns).

                        Every *simple* idea corresponds to a *simple impression*
                        that resembles it.

                        However, some terms have no clear ideas behind them!
                        We think they mean something, but they actually don't!
                        This happens frequently - try to trace any term
                        to an impression. If we can, it's a meaningful word
                        expressing an idea. If we can't, it's nonsense.

                        We should try to remove the term from our reasoning.

                        Author: "For my part, when I enter most intimately into
                        what I call *myself*, I always stumble on some
                        particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light
                        or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never
                        can catch *myself* at any time without a perception,
                        and never can observe any thing without a perception.
                        When my perceptions are remov'd for any time, as by
                        a sound sleep; so long am I insensible of *myself*,
                        and may truly be said not to exist. And were all my
                        poerceptions remov'd by death and cou'd I neither
                        think, nor feel, nor see, nor love, nor hate after
                        the dissolution of my body, I shou'd be entirely
                        annihilated, nor do I conceive what is farther
                        requisite to make me a perfect non-entity.
                        If any one upon serious and unprejudic'd reflexion,
                        thinks he has a different notion of *himself*, I must
                        confess I can reason no longer with him. All I can
                        allow him is, that he may be in the right as well
                        as I, and that we are essentially different in this
                        particular. He may, perhaps, perceive something simple
                        and continu'd, which he calls *himself*; tho' I am
                        certain there is no such principle in me."

                        Hume's attack: Number 1 is about the *relation of ideas*,
                        not about *facts*. Maybe I can't think about God
                        without thinking that he exists, but that doesn't

                        hitherto met with, I have always remark'd, that the
                        author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of
                        reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or
                        makes observations about human affairs; when of
                        a sudden I am surpriz'd to find, that instead of
                        the usual copulations of propositions, *is*, and
                        *is not*, I meet with no proposition that is not
                        connected with an *ought*, or *ought not*. This change
                        is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last
                        consequence. For as this *ought* or *ought not*,
                        expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis
                        necessary that it shou'd be observ'd and explain'd;
                        and at the same time that a reason should be given,
                        for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this
                        new relation can be a deduction from others,
                        which are entirely different from it. But as authors
                        do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume
                        to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that
                        this small attention wou'd subvert all the vulgar
                        [i.e., common] systems of morality, and let us see,
                        that the distinction of vice and virtue is not
                        founded merely on the relations of objects,

                        1. We can't *really* bring ourselves to doubt
                        everything.

                        from full-on Cartesian doubt - you can always
                        doubt your own faculties.

                        2. "Mitigated" skepticism: keep in mind the
                        "strange infirmities of human understanding",
                        supports modesty, goes against dogmatism
