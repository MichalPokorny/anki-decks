                        obzvlášť hezkou dívku.

                        bojovat.

                        Anaximander předpokládá balanci, která musí být
                        navrácena, ať převážil kterýkoli element.
                        Je to extenze Homerova vidění (který vykresloval balanci
                        emocí - hněv, pýcha vedou k boží odplatě).
                        Tento princip podle Anaximandra platí i všude ve světě,
                        nejen mezi lidmi.
                        Tento princip taky není od bohů, ale od světa samotného.
                        Takhle podle Anaximandra svět prostě funguje - to je
                        odpojení od Homéra (s Thaletem).

                        <br>
                        The source of unhappiness is a lack of harmony in
                        soul. Reason makes the decisions, supported by spirit,
                        desire is channeled appropriately.
                        <br><br>
                        Justice happens when people are in harmony.
                        Soul is happy when it is in harmony, hence "just".
                        We have *social justice* and *internal personal justice*.
                        Plato needs to show that *social justice* is good
                        for the individual.
                        *Internal justice*, it has been shown, is good for itself.
                        <br>
                        To be unjust is to allow the "internal beast" to rule
                        and overwhelm "the man within".
                        To be good is to be just,
                        so the Form of Justice takes us to the Form of the Good.

                        As with Socrates, contrast between the many and the few.
                        Plato is consciously and explicitly rejecting
                        Athenian democracy. Not everyone is equally fit to govern.
                        Where democracy rules, rhetoric and persuasion carry
                        the day, not reason and wisdom.

                        or that they "know ships".
                        But they don't know anything about the sky, the stars,
                        the sea, etc.
                        They think navigation is not teachable,
                        and nothing can enable one to steer the ship better.
                        <br><br>
                        True captain would be called a babbler and

                        it's not possible to participate

                        His account is for *souls in general* and for *rational souls*.
                        <br><br>
                        *In general*: soul doesn't feel pity, learn or think -
                        man does. Sometimes those penetrate to soul.
                        <br><br>
                        Sensation starts from particular objects;
                        recollection starts from soul.
                        Sensation cannot occur without body. Recollections
                        have bodily effects (e.g., running to catch a bus).
                        A person is *one being* with *one essence*.
                        <br><br>
                        Soul is a *substance*, inasmuch as it is the form of
                        a natural body that potentially possesses life.
                        A soul is a form for a *primary substance*.
                        If the eye were an animal, its soul would be sight.

                         (2) we feel fear and anger without choice,

                        Role of reason is *finding this mean*, the right amount.

                        Lawyer asks "Who is my neighbour?"
                        <br><br>
                        A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
                        and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat
                        him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
                        Now by chance a priest was going down that road;
                        and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.
                        So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place
                        and saw him, passed by on the other side.
                        But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he
                        was; and when he saw him, he had compassion,
                        and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on
                        oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast
                        and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
                        And the next day he took out two denarii and gave
                        them to the innkeeper, saying: "Take care of him;
                        and whatever more you spend, I will repay you
                        when I come back". Which of these three, do you think,
                        proved neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?
                        <br><br>
                        He said: "The one who showed mercy on him."
                        <br><br>
                        And Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."

                        Living is better than existing, so plants are better
                        than stones. Rationality is better than existing, so
                        we are better than plants. So with the truth.

                back: >
                        We cannot recognize truth just by being told it,
                        words are at most *signs*. They represent some reality.
                        Some words signify other signs ("noun"),
                        some signify realities ("horse").
                        Knowledge may be expressed as signs, but not necessarily.
                        We do not learn from words - we must understand.
                        Words are at best reminders.
                        We don't consult a speaker, but the truth he has within.
                        Christ is who teaches, inside all of us. Every rational
                        minds consults him. Everyone receives as much as he
                        can because of his own good or bad will.
                        The inner light is like the light of the Sun.
                        God is, God is apprehended and God causes other
                        things to be apprehended.
                        Noone ever teaches another person anything.
                        For Augustine, we learn by contronting realities,
                        illuminated by the Interion Teacher: Christ.

                        Plotinus was familiar with mystical experience.
                        Multiplicity of things disappears.
                        Identity of the self with "the All", "the One",
                        "God"; untroubled bliss.
                        <br><br>
                        He talks about this reality as **the One**.
                        <br><br>
                        We can say nothing about *the One*, since
                        it would imply some multiplicity in it. It's "ineffable".
                        It's majesty *beyond being*. "Unity" / "the Transcendent"
                        / "the Good", "the Source".
                        <br><br>
                        The One is the source of whatever else exists.
                        It makes all things possible. Not a plurality,
                        but a source of plurality.
                        <br><br>
                        There are Many because the One is ungrudging in giving.
                        <br><br>
                        **Great Chain of Being**: reality partitioned
                        in graded steps, between the One and vanishingly
                        small realities.

                        Because things lack some qualities doesn't make them

                        By necessity, not everything can be perfect
                        (like God is).

                        The present is only an infinitesimal instant.
                        When time is present, it has no duration -
                        the knife edge between *what is not yet* and

                        <br><br>
                        If we speak accurately, memory is *present of things
                        past*, direct awareness is *present of things
                        present*, expectation is *present of things future*.

                        Time has no meaning apart from the mind,
                        so it *must* have come into being along with creation.
                        Minds are not eternal. In posession expectation,
                        attention and memory, minds are where time realizes
                        itself. As such, they are a faint image of God,
                        who also sees past, present and future.
                        God, unlike us, lives in a "never-ending present" -
                        he knows all time at once.

                        Not just not being aware of true ordering
                        of value. Not *simple* ignorance.
                        If we are ignorant, we are *willingly* so.
                        We don't *want* to see truth and we obscure it
                        and complain it's too obscure. Education is not enough:

                        Will is itself a good thing. (All created things are

                        <br><br>
                        Free will: an *intermediate good*. Whether it
                        leads to happiness is up to us.
                        <br><br>
                        Will commits sin when it turns away from
                        immutable and common goods towards its private good.
                        Thus man becomes proud, meddlesome and lustful.

                back: >
                        Pride is the root of sin.
                        "God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will
                        be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good
                        and evil." They wanted to be "like God".
                        <br><br>
                        The original sin: man regards himself as his own
                        light, and turns away from that light which would
                        make man himself a light if he would
                        set his heart on it.
                        <br><br>
                        There is no efficient cause of an evil choice.
                        It's not a matter of efficiency, but of deficiency.
                        <br>
                        If there were a cause for evil, it would - since it
                        is - be good. The cause for sin is that incomplete
                        being of the will is a *necessary condition* for sin.
                        If sin had an efficient cause, it would not
                        be subject to punishment.

                        Choosing those is our act of free will.

                        and hearing Beethoven.
                        We *receive* wisdom and must be humble

                        conceived*. We can conceive of something greater:
                        which exists in both senses.

                        It the series were infinite, there would be
                        no cause which is "first", so there would be no
                        intermediate causes and no ultimate causes.

                        We want to say he's not just the *cause* of life,
                        wisdom, goodness, but also *is* itself alive,
                        wise, good.
                        <br><br>
                        The meaning of "wise" (etc.) is derived from
                        experience with human/animal wisdom, not from
                        experience of God.
                        <br><br>
                        Blood, food, etc is called "healthly" because
                        of its relation with healthy people (who are
                        actually healthy). Same with God. The words we
                        use express God's substance imperfectly just as
                        creatures (having any perfection) represent
                        him imperfectly.
                        <br><br>
                        "God is good" doesn't mean either "God causes
                        goodness" or "God is not bad", but "What we call
                        goodness in creatures pre-existat in a higher
                        way in God".
                        <br><br>
                        The words "wise", "good" etc. are learned by
                        application to creatures. Creatures are good
                        because God creates goodness. For creatures,
                        "good" is an extra attribute.
                        <br><br>
                        Univocal words: used with just 1 meaning.
                        Aquinas denies that words used of creatures and
                        creator are univocally used.

                        <br><br>
                        Could God cause the experience without the mediation

                        <br><br>
                        Yes, it wouldn't be self-contradictory.
                        <br><br>
                        Since knowledge comes from *certainty*,
                        we can't be certain that there actually is a tangerine
                        if we perceive one.
                        <br><br>
                        So with causation: what if fire doesn't cause cloth
                        to burn, but God always intervenes?

                        Outer sphere: Empyrean. Heavy things fall towards
                        Earth. Between Earth and Moon: lighter elements (air,
                        fire). All elements suffer constant change, mixing.
                        Change comes from motion of heavens. Outermost spheres
                        rotate very fast (to come to the same position in
                        24 hours). Inner spheres drawn by friction. Spheres
                        move because they desire to be united with Heaven.

                        Dante lost his way and couldn't find it again.
                        <br><br>
                        Pagan poet Virgil appears, offers to lead him through
                        hell, purgatory and gates of Heaven. There, Virgil will
                        be supplanted (he can't enter). These visions should
                        resolve Dante's crisis.

                        of Mainz (would make him Germany's top cleric).
                        Pope demanded 10 000 ducats. Parishes couldn't
                        supply the fee, so he paid it himself,
                        borrowing at 20% interest from banking house of Fugger.
                        Agreed indulgences would be sold in his territories;
                        half the income used to repay the loan, half sent to
                        Rome to help build Saint Peter's Cathedral.

                        Troubled by his sins, in terror of God's justice.
                        Couldn't be sure his motivations were pure.
                        Never confient he searched out every tinge of
                        selfishness, greed, lust, pride. Agonies of doubt,
                        self-accusation.

                        Became professor of theology. Wrestled with Psalms,
                        letters of Saint Paul. Found the only thing needed was
                        belief in Jesus Christ to win forgiveness for sinners
                        such as himself. Salvation doesn't have to be *earned*!
                        It's a *gift*.

                        Church supports it, but that doesn't make it *right*.
                        Church often flatly disagrees with Scripture.
                        Only *divine authority* can support indulgences.
                        And there is none: Neither Christ nor those
                        who knew him supported it.

                        Raymond Sebond: origin and work
                back: >
                        15th century theologian. Claimed not only can God's
                        existence be proven by reason (as Augustine, Anselm,
                        Aquinas), but *all* doctrines of Christianity can.

                back: >
                        Montaigne translated Sebond's book to French
                        at his father's request. Set out to defend Sebond's
                        thesis (apology: defense, as with Socrates).

                        Strategy:
                        <ul>
                        <li> Christianity depends entirely on faith
                        <li> Sebond's proofs can be used to demonstrate
                             anything. His arguments are as solid as any others
                             of the same type that may be opposed by them.
                        <li> Therefore, arguments for are as good as arguments
                             against.
                        </ul>

                        Montaigne wonders: Are we superior to animals at all?
                        Who are we to know? We also obviously can't trust our
                        senses. We are often deceived by reason. Science
                        progresses and theories are always overthrown later.
                        It's difficult or impossible to know the truth
                        about the universe.

                        Other creatures may have natural laws, but they
                        are lost in us. Human reason "butts in everywhere",
                        confusing things with vanity and inconsistency.
                        Truth about right and wrong is unavailable to us.
                        (Similar to Pico, but this is *despair*, not glory.)

                        Our justifications go in circles or in infinite
                        regress. Nothing can be established about anything. Our
                        senses may not even correspond at all to external
                        realities. We can't even find out whether they do.

                        *Skepticism used as a defence of the status quo.*
                        Montaigne brought up a Catholic, sensible
                        thing is to keep customs we grew up in.

                        Ptolemaic epicycles not entirely abolished.
                        Retains notion that celestial bodies move in circles;
                        notion of celestial spheres is still important.
                        Accepts that the universe is finite, through much
                        larger than thought before.
                        The sun is also not *clearly* in the center
                        (as most popular accounts of his views state).

                        Problem that Copernicus cracked,
                        his solution
                back: >
                        Apparently irregular movement of planets:
                        they appear to move slowly eastward against
                        fixed stars, then reverse course and go west.

                        Solution: the movement is only apparent,
                        the cause is actual movement of observers on Earth.

                        His solution is only a little bit more accurate,
                        and not much less complex than the Ptolemaic view.
                        It's more "harmonic", through.

                        Each thing as far as in it lies, continues always

                        continues to move.

                        All motion is of itself in a straight line.
                        Things which move in circles tend to recede from
                        the centre of the circle.

                        Aristotle: all things tend to the center, and don't
                        want to keep moving. This only makes sense in an
                        infinite universe *with no center*.

                        change, yet we judge it to be the same piece of wax.
                        So, judgement is necessary.

                                Are we cogs in a machine? Is there
                                room for purposes? Do we have free will?

                                Descartes's solution: radically split mind and
                                body.

                                We aren't automata (we have language),
                                we are more flexible and adaptable than any
                                machine.

                                Descartes: mind and body are separate,
                                yet we are a unity. How can we be at the same

                                If God deceives or doesn't exist,
                                it's a big problem.

                        man above the rest of sensible beings, and gives him
                        all the advantage and dominion which he has over them;
                        it is certainly a subject, even for its nobleness,
                        worth our labor to inquire into. The understanding,
                        like the eye, whilst it makes us see and perceive
                        all other things, takes no notice of itself: and it
                        requires art and pains to set it at a distance
                        and make it its own object."

                        Locke thinks there are *no* innate ideas.

                        Not even trivialities are innate (not present
                        in idiots, childern).
                        Ideas and knowledge come from *experience*.

                        Experience is *sensation* and *reflection*
                        (on how our minds work).

                        Sensation lets us frame material substances.

                        We have the *complex idea of an immaterial spirit*.
                        Those cannot be just actions of bare insensible

                        What actually gives me the idea of *myself* at all
                        is consciousness.
                        Our identity reaches as far back as our consciousness
                        does. We remember past experiences of our past selves.
                        Personal identity isn't sameness of substance,
                        including sameness of *soul* substance.

                        Locke thinks it's "probable" that one soul is attached
                        to one consciousness.

                        Distinction between civil commonwealth, state
                        and church.

                        Commonwealth: society of men advancing their Civil
                        Interests -- life, liberty, health, possession, etc.
                        Duty of Civil Magistrate: impartially execute
                        equal laws, secure possessions.

                        Church: voluntary society, men joining for public
                        worship of God.
                        Civil authorities have no business here,
                        same as ecclesiastical authorities shouldn't try
                        to gain worldly power.
                        Civil power obligated to tolerate differences
                        in which men seek to relate to God. Care of every
                        man's soul belongs unto himself.

                        Counterargument: Religious dissenters were
                        historically dangerous to civil order.
                        Counter-counterargument: Just because they were
                        discriminated.

                        Abuse of language.

                        Locke:
                        We have universal words, and general words function
                        as *names* for abstract ideas.
                        "Tiger" means "what is common to all tigers", neither
                        small nor large tiger, not male or female.

                        Berkeley: This is nonsense. The mind *doesn't have
                        a power of framing abstract ideas or notions
                        of things*.
                        The idea of "man": would have *some* color, but at
                        the same time *no color in particular*. Same with
                        stature.

                        We don't actually have an *idea* of existence
                        (of *nothing in particular*), same with *substance*,
                        *motion*, *solidity*, etc.

                        We may have *general* ideas, but not **abstract**
                        general ideas.

                        Their generality is not in their intrinsic nature,
                        but in how we use them.

                        Every word and every idea is particular.

                        "Tiger" has universal significance not because it
                        stands for an abstract idea (there is none),
                        but because those letters and sounds refer
                        to any tiger.
                        Thinking that such words are *names* is an
                        abuse of language.

                        Things, which are in their nature particular,
                        are rendered universal by relations.

                        We know of God the same way I know of your spirit.

                        This is why things have an independent existence from
                        us: God perceives them.

                        However, some terms have no clear ideas behind them!
                        We think they mean something, but they actually don't!
                        This happens frequently - try to trace any term
                        to an impression. If we can, it's a meaningful word
                        expressing an idea. If we can't, it's nonsense.

                        what I call *myself*, I always stumble on some
                        particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light
                        or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never

                        and never can observe any thing without a perception.
                        When my perceptions are remov'd for any time, as by
                        a sound sleep; so long am I insensible of *myself*,
                        and may truly be said not to exist. And were all my
                        poerceptions remov'd by death and cou'd I neither

                        requisite to make me a perfect non-entity.
                        If any one upon serious and unprejudic'd reflexion,
                        thinks he has a different notion of *himself*, I must
                        confess I can reason no longer with him. All I can
                        allow him is, that he may be in the right as well
                        as I, and that we are essentially different in this
                        particular. He may, perhaps, perceive something simple
                        and continu'd, which he calls *himself*; tho' I am

                        </ol>

                        Hume's attack: (1) is about the *relation of ideas*,
                        not about *facts*. Maybe I can't think about God
                        without thinking that he exists, but that doesn't
                        say anything about whether he *really exists*.
                        Transition (3 &rarr; 4) is illegitimate.

                        *Relations of ideas can't prove matters of fact.*

                        our knowledge of the world being orderly.

                        Author: "In every system of morality, which I have
                        hitherto met with, I have always remark'd, that the
                        author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of
                        reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or
                        makes observations about human affairs; when of
                        a sudden I am surpriz'd to find, that instead of
                        the usual copulations of propositions, *is*, and
                        *is not*, I meet with no proposition that is not
                        connected with an *ought*, or *ought not*. This change
                        is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last
                        consequence. For as this *ought* or *ought not*,
                        expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis
                        necessary that it shou'd be observ'd and explain'd;
                        and at the same time that a reason should be given,
                        for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this
                        new relation can be a deduction from others,
                        which are entirely different from it. But as authors
                        do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume
                        to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that
                        this small attention wou'd subvert all the vulgar
                        [i.e., common] systems of morality, and let us see,
                        that the distinction of vice and virtue is not
                        founded merely on the relations of objects,
                        nor is perceiv'd by reason."

                        We can't know whether our ideas correspond
                        to an idea-less object. On the basis
                        of concepts, we can know nothing outside our minds.
                        All of this follows from: 1. we are acquainted
                        only with experienced ideas, 2. objects exist
                        independently of our experience, 3. knowledge
                        requires that we ascertain correspondence between
                        ideas and objects.

                        Maybe objects of experience are constructions of
                        rational mind, and have no reality independent
                        of their construction. Rational minds have some
                        structure (including, e.g. causality), and the
                        structure is **imposed** on objects known by them.

                        A) epistemological question: does it rest on experience,
                        or not?

                        B) semantic question: how do the meanings of the
                        words we use to express the knowledge relate to each
                        other?

                        1. Epistemological:

                        1a: A priori: known to be true without any reference
                        to experience (7+5=12)

                        1b. A posteriori: when we must appeal to experience
                        to determine truth or falsity.

                        2. Semantic:

                        2a: Analytic: when its denial yields a contradiction.
                        For example: "All bodies are extended."
                        (The predicate "extended" is already included in "body".)
                        If an analytical judgement is true, it is necessarily
                        true. (Every father has a child.)

                        2b. Synthetic: does more than explicate or analyze
                        a concept. "Every event has a cause.", "Air has weight."
                        The opposite of synthetic judgements is always
                        possible.

                        The test for analycity is examining denial of judgement
                        for contradiction, so we also don't have to examine
                        experience.
                        All analytic judgements must be a priori.

                        and our experience are just its modifications.

                        Mind and body are not substances, but attributes
                        under which the one substance can be conceived.

                        For every natural body, there is an idea.
                        The mind is the idea corresponding to a human body.
                        Mind and body are identical, mental changes
                        and bodily changes isomorphic.

                        There is no free will, because everything is a necessary
                        expression of the divine nature. Freedom is just
                        the power to act from one's own nature.
                        God is the only completely free being.

                        We are *in bondage* of emotions (love, desire, hate).
                        Emotions are *caused in us*. We move towards freedom
                        by intellectual love of God, coming to see necessities
                        of the world as God sees them. This knowledge is the
                        source of power to act (rather than react), virtue
                        and joy; thus we can approximate the blessed life
                        of God.

                        The illusion is that there categories are applicable
                        further than sensible intuition, without regard
                        to sensibility. But they *don't* thereby determine
                        a greater sphere of objects.

                        For instance, the concept "substance" is not a complete
                        concept on its own right. It's just a *rule* for
                        organizing content, which must be given by intuition.

                        When we say "I think", we aren't peering at or describing
                        our self. The contents of what we think comes *after*
                        the phrase.

                        We don't and can't have any knowledge whatsoever
                        of any such subject.

                        We cannot infer *noumenal reality* just because of
                        our grammatical tendency to use the word *I*.
                        A necessity in my mode of representing myself
                        doesn't translate into a metaphysical necessity
                        about my nature.

                        Distinction between noumena and phenomena.

                        Every event can be both natural and free.
                        Thinking that we can only be free or only deterministic
                        is a presumptuous position of *absolute reality*.

                        Every appearance has 2 aspects: it's something that
                        appears in the world of our experience, it's something
                        in itself.

                        As appearance, a part of the world of nature,
                        it's governed by nature's principles.
                        In this aspect, every action is causally determined.

                        But as a thing in itself, we can't even say
                        it occurs in time!
                        And the category of causality doesn't extend beyond
                        the bounds of experience, so an act of will may even
                        be *absolutely* free as in Descartes.

                        Concept of "that than which nothing greater
                        may be conceived" has just a verbal definition.

                        All alleged examples are taken from *judgements*,
                        not from things and their existence. But necessity of
                        judgements is not the same as absolute necessity of
                        things. If we reject the absolutely necessary being, we
                        reject the thing itself with all its predicates; so
                        then there is no contradiction.

                        (Rejecting 3 angles in a triangle is a contradiction.
                        Rejecting the triangle altogether is not.)

                        Counterargument: When atheists reject God, they *must*
                        have a concept of it to reject it.

                        Counter-counterargument:
                        "Being" is obviously not a real predicate.
                        It's not a concept of something that could be added
                        to the concept of a thing. It's just the positing
                        of a thing as existing in themselves.

                        ("Being" / "existence" is not a predicate in the sense
                        "being a triangle" is. To say that some concept has
                        *being* means claiming that the concept *applies*
                        to something.)

                        *Every* judgement of existence is *synthetic*.

                        The whole phenomenal world is a manifestation of

                        It's absurd to try to use knowledge to know knowledge.
                        Knowing what knowing is *presupposes* that we can
                        know something.

                        Kant's project also gives too much to skepticism.
                        It's unsatisfactory that all we can ever know
                        are appearances, never things-in-themselves.

                        Hegel's solution: the distinction between consciousness
                        and its objects is *internal* to consciousness.

                        How does the object-appearance distinction appear
                        in consciousness?
                back: >
                        When we find discrepancy between awareness and its
                        objects, consciousness corrects itself to make
                        awareness more adequate. But the object has not stayed
                        put, so we see that what we thought the object *is*,
                        now it just *appears to be*. It formerly had
                        the status of *thing-in-itself*, and now it's
                        seen as having been an object *just for us*.
                        Thus the reality-appearance distinction arises
                        *within consciousness*.

                        Previous philosophers naively thought it existed
                        *between* consciousness and something
                        independent of consciousness.

                        Phenomenology traces the dialectical succession
                        of more and more adequate stages of consciousness.

                        Sense-certainty "attempts to be" simply sense-certainty,
                        tries to *negate itself*. It tries to know just

                        of that attempt is displayed in itself.
                        The attempt *necessarily* involves "this", "here",

                        This negation is *not* skepticism - it's a determinate

                        describing properties. (Is a thing a mere collection

                        of *laws* (e.g. Newton). These are thought to express
                        the truth of things and providing explanations.
                        But in producing those, consciousness is *active*, not
                        merely passive.

                        Consciousness *desires* to know.
                        Desire is not just conscious, it is explicitly
                        *self-consicious* - *I* want. Desire is a form
                        of self-consciousness - it revels being *other*
                        from the world revealed to sense.

                        But that doesn't yet reveal the *self* as being
                        *self-conscious* - all we have in desire is the
                        disclosure of a difference between two poles,
                        not yet the *nature* of oneself.

                        Each recognizes the other's project.

                        So, they *recognize themselves as mutually recognizing

                        object in the world

                        come to control him

                        Stoicism *lacks reality*.

                        Stoicism "splits a person into 2 halves"

                        Kant: reason is a drive that must forever remain
                        unsatisfied. This limits knowledge to make room for
                        faith.

                        Hegel: his dialectic covers everything
                        the consciousness can ever be aware of. Everywhere,
                        consciousness just discovers itself. In every explanation,
                        it finds its own imposed values, laws, truths.
                        The consciousness *itself* is unconditioned,
                        this stage Hegel calls *reason*.
                        Reason is the certainty of consciousness that it is
                        all reality; thus does idealism express its Notion.

                        hitherto negative relation to otherness turns round
                        into a positive relation. Up till now it has been
                        concerned only with its independence and freedom,
                        concerned to save and maintain itself for itself at

                        both of which appeared to it as the negative of its
                        essence. But as Reason, assured of itself, it is at
                        peace with them, and can endure them; for it is certain
                        that it is itself reality, or that everything actual
                        is none other than itself; its thinking is itself
                        directly actuality, and thus its relationship to the
                        latter is that of idealism...

                        to reason -- that the reason in it is the same
                        as the reason in us.

                        Through we may find the assertion that consciousness

                        These "liberal" theorists identify themselves only with
                        their nonreflective, rationally uncriticized, given
                        desires (compare what Stoics and Skeptics did).
                        It's an *arbitrary will*.

                        If we think we're free when we can do what our
                        *arbitrary will* says, its own *arbitrariness* implies
                        that we are not free.

                        To be free, we must be *rational*, and since
                        rationality is intrinsically *universal*, we must be
                        *ethical*.
                        Reason cannot be the slave of the passions - it must
                        be a determining factor in action.

                        We need to synthesize the Stoic/Skeptical view with
                        Kant.

                back: >
                        Spirit wants to recognize itself in cultural
                        expressions. Recognizing rationality in institutions -
                        property, contracts, family, the state.
                        Spirit reappropriates its products after alienating
                        itself from them, and expesses itself in the
                        social dimension.

                        Ethics is virtually indistinguishable from social
                        and political philosophy - it is the *realization*
                        of philosophy in an actual community.

                        The individual must be noted as part of society.
                        Origin of state as social contract between individuals
                        is, to Hegel, an undue abstraction.
                        An individual per se is an *abstraction* from the whole.
                        The community (the *State*) is the bearer of objective
                        reality of spirit, "higher" than the individual.
                        The state is an organism.

                        It must be rational and have impartial and universal
                        laws, and rational and free individuals can give
                        their rational and free consent to it. The state
                        is the correlate of reason.

                        Here he wants to harmonize *custom* and *morality*
                        stages.

                        whole. Hence if the state claims life, the individual
                        must surrender it...
                        The rational end of man is life in the state, and if
                        there is no state there, reason at once demands that
                        one be founded... It is false to maintain that
                        the foundation of the state is something at the
                        option of all its members. It's nearer to truth to say
                        that it is absolutely necessary for every individual

                        or not, right or wrong, is determined, for the ordinary

                        Reason cannot sweep up the board and start anew.
                        We should each actualize the norms of our society,
                        and not go off on individualistic tangents.
                        We should recognize what is *already rational* and
                        strengthen that.

                        Eventually, when spirit becomes fully *concrete*,
                        we will recognize ourselves in our institutions.
                        All will be in harmony, as in stage of *custom*,
                        but now in *rational harmony*.

                        Spirit will take care of itself, both in social
                        settings and in epistemology.

                        Being is a function of reason - *nothing* can have
                        a nonrational existence.
                        Reason is power: because it has itself as its own
                        final purpose and works itself from potentiality
                        to actuality.

                        Reason seems like another term for Absolute or
                        World Spirit.
