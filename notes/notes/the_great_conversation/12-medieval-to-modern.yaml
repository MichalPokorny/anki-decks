                Medieval picture of the world
        back: |
                Universe: harmonious, coherent, created by infinite and good
                God as home for humans, made for our sake. Sky is a thing
                (a dome). Each astronomical object in its own sphere.
                <br><br>
                Outer sphere: Empyrean. Heavy things fall towards Earth.
                Between Earth and Moon: lighter elements (air, fire). All
                elements suffer constant change, mixing. Change comes from
                motion of heavens. Outermost spheres rotate very fast (to come
                to the same position in 24 hours). Inner spheres drawn by
                friction. Spheres move because they desire to be united with
                Heaven.

                Pagan poet Virgil appears, offers to lead him through
                hell, purgatory and gates of Heaven, where Virgil will
                be supplanted (he can't enter). The visions should
                resolve Dante's crisis.

                Troubled by sins, in terror of God's justice. Couldn't be sure
                motivations were pure. Never confient he sought out every tinge
                of selfishness, greed, lust, pride. Agonies of doubt,
                self-accusation.

                Became professor of theology, wrestled with Psalms,
                letters of Saint Paul. Found the only thing needed was
                belief in Jesus Christ to win forgiveness for sinners
                such as himself. Salvation doesn't have to be *earned*!

                Church supports it, but that doesn't make it *right*.
                Church often flatly disagrees with Scripture.
                Only *divine authority* can support indulgences.
                And there is none: Neither Christ nor those
                who knew him supported it.

                Topic: Apology for Raymond Sebond
        back: |
                Montaigne translated Sebond's book to French
                at his father's request. Set out to defend Sebond's
                thesis (apology: defense, as with Socrates).

                Strategy:
                <ul>
                <li> Christianity depends entirely on faith
                <li> Sebond's proofs can be used to demonstrate
                     anything. His arguments are as solid as any others
                     of the same type that may be opposed by them.
                <li> Therefore, arguments for are as good as arguments
                     against.
                </ul>

                Montaigne wonders: Are we superior to animals at all?
                Who are we to know? We also obviously can't trust our
                senses. We are often deceived by reason. Science
                progresses and theories are always overthrown later.
                It's difficult or impossible to know the truth
                about the universe.

                Other creatures may have natural laws, but they
                are lost in us. Human reason "butts in everywhere",
                confusing things with vanity and inconsistency.
                Truth about right and wrong is unavailable to us.
                (Similar to Pico, but this is *despair*, not glory.)

                Our justifications go in circles or in infinite
                regress. Nothing can be established about anything. Our
                senses may not even correspond at all to external
                realities. We can't even find out whether they do.

                *Skepticism used as a defence of the status quo.*
                Montaigne brought up a Catholic, sensible
                thing is to keep customs we grew up in.
