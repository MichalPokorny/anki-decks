                soul-thing distinct from body. A person has a soul of a certain
                sort, but it's not a thing; it's simply the "form" of sort of
                body that a man has. A person is not a "tandem" of "stoker" and
                "captain" &mdash; we are unified creatures.

        back: |
                Every uncombined term indicates substance or quantity
                or quality or relationship to something or place or
                time or posture or state or the doing of something
                or the undergoing of something.

        back: |
                Statements are made from terms. Terms are not true or
                false on their own. Statements are.

                Most real things there are - not just shadows.

        front: What are *secondary substances*?
        back: |
                Primary substances belong, as species, to secondary substances.
                E.g., "man", "animal" are secondary substances.
                (What is fully real is the individual thing.)

                Knowledge develops from implicit to more explicit forms.

                From traces of what animals/people perceive in numerous
                encounters with environment. From experience
                comes a *universal*, a sense of unity of the
                many things encountered.

                Rout ending in battle: individual men fleeing (many

                stands (memory), the another (solidifying), and another
                (experience), until battle line forms (One made from
                Many).
                <br><br>
                When one percept "has come to a halt",
                this is first beginning of the presence there of a universal.
                E.g., a particular species of animal leads to the genus "animal", etc.
                We acquire knowledge of primary premises by induction,
                and this is how sense-perception provides us with universals.

                <li> <i>Multiplication</i>: Explaining real world by

                     have in common</i> and <i>being individual realities</i>
                     conflict. Individual substances &rarr;
                     no sense to think of them as shared among
                     substances. Universal (non-individual) &rarr;

                     separately from particulars.
                     Aristotle: Being-a-man is not realized in a Form,
                     but only in <i>each individual man</i>.
                     Forms just add "-itself" to sensible terms.

                Forms depend on individual substances.

                Is *nous* just an aspect of the form of living human
                bodies? Why?
        back: |
                No.<br><br>
                *Analogy to sight*: need a red car, an eye and light.
                Capacity to register qualities too passive to count
                as knowledge. Need something more active.
                <br><br>
                "*Light*" is separate, incapable of being acted upon,
                mixed with nothing, and in essence an actuality.
                Passive power of *nous* can potentially "become
                everything"
                (register color of the car, etc.), but you
                need an active power in the mind to actually know.

                <ul>
                <li> <i>Not an emotion</i>: (1) we are blamed not for being
                angry but for giving in, (2) we feel fear and anger without
                choice, but virtues are a kind of choice (or aren't possible
                without it). We can't be good <i>naturally</i>.
                <li> <i>Not innate</i>: we have a capacity for them, but learn
                by practicing until they become habits. <i>Can be taught.</i>
                <li> <i>Many virtues</i> (vs Plato, Socrates); possibly
                independent. Often, brave men are not moderate. In perfection,
                you can't have one virtue without having all.

                On the mean - of emotions, etc. We should have *right* amount
                of fear, for example - not too much, not too little.
                <br><br>
                Right amount depends on *circumstances* and *person*. What is
                courageous for one may be cowardly for another. This is an
                *objective* relativity.
                <br><br>
                Role of reason is *finding this mean*, the right amount. That
                is *practical sense* or *practical wisdom*.
