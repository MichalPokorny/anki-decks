                and is a champion of reason. On the other hand,
                the ideal of harmony along humans is his own.

        front: Objection to science of human nature, critique of pure reason
        back: |
                It's absurd to try to use knowledge to know knowledge.
                Knowing what knowing is *presupposes* that we can
                know something.

                Kant's project also gives too much to skepticism.
                It's unsatisfactory that all we can ever know are appearances,
                never things-in-themselves.

                Hegel's solution: distinction between consciousness and its
                objects is *internal* to consciousness.

                of the object, and on the other, consciousness of itself;
                consciousness of what for it is the True, and consciousness of
                its knowledge of the truth. Since both are *for* the same
                consciousness, this consciousness is itself their comparison;
                it is for this same consciousness to know whether its knowledge
                of the object corresponds to the object or not."

                How does object-appearance distinction appear in consciousness?
        back: |
                When we find discrepancy between awareness and its objects,
                consciousness corrects itself to make awareness more adequate.
                But the object has not stayed put, so we see that what we
                thought the object *is*, now it just *appears to be*.
                It formerly had the status of *thing-in-itself*, and now it's
                seen as having been an object *just for us*. Thus
                the reality-appearance distinction arises *in consciousness*.

                Previous philosophers naively thought it existed *between*
                consciousness and something independent of it.

                Phenomenology traces the dialectical succession of more and
                more adequate stages of consciousness.

                Just *sensing* - not thinking about it.
                It's wholly *receptive*, like Hume's impressions.
                There are no Kantian filters and the knowledge
                is "unmediated" by interpretative schemes.
                It's *immediate experience*.
                It's a *particular in its sheer particularity*.

        topic: Hegel
        front: Character of sense-certainty
        back: |
                Appears to be *richest* and *truest* knowledge, because it
                hasn't ommitted anything from the object. But the certainty
                proves to be the most abstract and poorest *truth*.

                Consciousness *cannot say what it knows*.

                Hegel: if we only had sense-certainty (no narratives,
                explanations, remebrance, etc.), we couldn't be said to have
                *any knowledge at all*.
-       guid: zbgr$aB;n?
        topic: Hegel
        front: What does consciousness do with sense-certainty?
        back: |
                Impelled to go beyond. Internal dialectic forces consciousness
                to recognoze inadequacy of sense-certainty.

                Sense-certainty "attempts to be" simply sense-certainty, tries
                to *negate itself*. Tries to know just what is present to it,
                but fails, and insufficency of that attempt is displayed in
                itself. The attempt *necessarily* involves "this", "here",
                "now", "I".

                Negation is *not* skepticism - it's a determinate and specific
                negation of sufficiency of sense-certainty for knowledge.

        topic: Hegel
        front: Can consciousness find knowledge in retreating to elementary beginning
                points?
        back: |
                No. We must keep plunging ahead with our concepts,
                interpretations of experience, and hope to establish
                correspondence between subject and object. Mind *must* play an
                active role.

        back: |
                Understands it's not knowledge, but starts to interpret it in
                terms of richer concepts. What is true in earlier stages is
                preserved and incorporated at next level. Hegel find this
                dialectical pattern repeated.

                <i>Perception</i>: objects characterized by concepts describing
                properties. (Is a thing a mere collection of properties? Is
                there some *substance* beyond them?)
                <li>
                <i>Understanding</i>: things understood in *laws* (e.g.
                Newton). Laws thought to express truth and provide
                explanations. In producing laws, consciousness is *active*,
                not merely passive.
                <li>
                <i>Self-consciousness</i>: consciousness recognizes its active
                contribution to understanding.

        back: |
                Incorporating the other into itself. Consciousness *desires* to
                know. Desire is not just conscious, it is explicitly
                *self-consicious* - *I* want. Desire is a form of
                self-consciousness - revels being *other* from world revealed
                to sense.

                But that doesn't yet reveal *self* as being *self-conscious* -
                all we have in desire is disclosure of difference between 2
                poles, not yet *nature* of oneself.

                it so exists for another; that is, it exists
                only in being acknowledged."

                Self-conscious people use each other at the "other" to make
                themselves self-conscious, try to "control" each other - to
                make the other equal to experience of him.

                Each wants to make the other his own, each recognizes the
                other's project.

                So, they *recognize themselves as mutually recognizing each
                other*. Consciousness of each other is not like consciousness
                of stones or pencils.

                <li> Smith recognizes I am aware of him
                <li> He realizes that *for me*, he is an object in the world
                <li> Like me, Smith is constituted by desire
                <li> Hence, Smith will not be content to leave me independent
                because thus I might come to control him
                <li> So I better not leave Smith independent, lest he control
                me

                What is the *stage of ethics*?
        back: |
                Spirit wants to recognize itself in cultural expressions.
                Recognizing rationality in institutions - property, contracts,
                family, state. Spirit reappropriates its products after
                alienating itself from them, and expresses itself in the social
                dimension.

                Ethics virtually indistinguishable from social, political
                philosophy - *realization* of philosophy in actual community.

                Hegel's idea of ideal *stage of ethics* society
        back: |
                Individual must be noted as part of society. Origin of state as
                social contract between people is, to Hegel, undue abstraction.
                Individual per se is *abstraction* from the whole. Community
                (*State*) bears objective reality of spirit, "higher" than
                individual. State is an organism.

                Must be rational and have impartial and universal laws,
                rational and free individuals can consent to it rationally and
                freely. State is the correlate of reason.

                Here he wants to harmonize *custom* and *morality* stages.

                Author: "A single person... is suomething subordinate,
                and as such he must dedicate himself to the ethical
                whole. Hence if the state claims life, the individual
                must surrender it...
                The rational end of man is life in the state, and if
                there is no state there, reason at once demands that
                one be founded... It is false to maintain that
                the foundation of the state is something at the
                option of all its members. It's nearer to truth to say
                that it is absolutely necessary for every individual
                to be a citizen."

                Author: "If men are to act, they must not only intend
                the good but must know whether this or that particular
                course is good. What special course of action is good
                or not, right or wrong, is determined, for the ordinary
                circumstances of private life, by the laws and customs
                of a state. It is not too difficult to know them. ...
                Each individual has his position; he knows,
                on the whole, what a lawful and honorable course of
                conduct is. To assert in ordinary private relations
                that it is difficult to choose the right and good, and
                to regard it as a mark of an exalted morality to find
                difficulties and raise scurples on that score indicates
                an evil and perverse will. It indicates a will that
                seeks to evade obvious duties or, at least, a petty
                will that gives its mind little to do."

                Reason can't sweep up the board and start anew. We should
                actualize norms of our society, not go off on individualistic
                tangents. Recognize what is *already rational*, strengthen it.

                Eventually, when spirit becomes fully *concrete*, we will
                recognize ourselves in institutions. All will be in harmony, as
                in stage of *custom*, but now in *rational harmony*.

                Spirit will take care of itself, both in social settings and in
                epistemology.

                Being is a function of reason - *nothing* exist nonrationally.
                Reason is power: it has itself as its own final goal, works
                itself from potentiality to actuality.

                Reason seems like another term for Absolute or
                World Spirit.

                always comes on the scene too late to give it. As
                the thought of the world, it appears only when
                actuality is already there cut and dried after its
                process of formation has been completed. ...When
                philosophy paints its grey in grey, then has a shape
                of life grown old. By philosophy's grey in grey it
                cannot be rejuvenated but only understood. The owl of
