                Story: Pears
        back: |
                With friends, shook down lots of pears from neighbour's tree
                and stole them. Didn't need them or eat them &mdash; threw
                them to the pigs.
                "Our real pleasure consisted in doing something that
                was forbidden."

                Attempt to exercise a liberty that belongs to God alone. In
                this prank by a 16-year-old, Augustine finds the root of human
                predicament: **pride**.
                <br><br>
                Peer pressure: "Come on, do it!"
                Wouldn't be fun to do it alone.

                Evil is because there's *no omnipotent good power*.

                we experience domination of foreign powers (matter, body,

                Having it does not guarantee happiness - we must desire right

                We can say "the pear should be more ripe".

                With its light, truth gives joy to the men who turn

        front: On how we recognize truth when we are told it
        back: |
                We cannot recognize truth just by being told it,
                words are at most *signs*. They represent some reality.
                Some words signify other signs ("noun"),
                some signify realities ("horse").
                Knowledge may be expressed as signs, but not necessarily.
                We do not learn from words - we must understand.
                Words are at best reminders.
                We don't consult a speaker, but the truth he has within.
                Christ is who teaches, inside all of us. Every rational
                minds consults him. Everyone receives as much as he
                can because of his own good or bad will.
                The inner light is like the light of the Sun.
                God is, God is apprehended and God causes other
                things to be apprehended.
                Noone ever teaches another person anything.
                For Augustine, we learn by contronting realities,
                illuminated by the Interion Teacher: Christ.

                Only an infinitesimal instant. When time is present, it has no

                Time has no meaning apart from the mind, so it *must* have come

                make man himself a light if he would
                set his heart on it.

                There is no efficient cause of an evil choice. It's not

                If there were a cause for evil, it would - since it is - be

                a *necessary condition* for sin. If sin had an efficient cause,
                it would not be subject to punishment.

                From cupidity comes *vice* and *crime*.

                There are differences in custom between
                cultures. *Circumstances* and *motivations*
                also must be taken into account when judging
                goodness/badness of an act. Old prophets practicing
                polygamy are not blamed.
