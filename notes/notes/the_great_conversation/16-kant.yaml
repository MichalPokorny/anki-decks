                Author: "The light dove, cleaving the air in her
                free flight and feeling its resistance, might imagine
                that its flight would be still easier in empty space.
                It was thus that Plato left the world of the senses,
                as setting too narrow limits to the understanding,
                and ventured out beyond it on the wings of ideas,
                in the empty space of the pure understanding.
                He did not observe that with all his efforts he made
                no advance &mdash; meeting no resistance that might,
                as it were, serve as a support upon which he could
                take a stand, to which he could apply his powers,
                and se set his understanding in motion."

                structure, relationship to its objects, and find limits where
                it works.

                Author: "Hitherto it has been assumed that all our
                knowledge must conform to objects. But all attempts
                to extend our knowledge of objects by establishing
                something in regard to them *a priori*, by means
                of concepts, have, on this assumption, ended in failure.
                We must therefore make trial whether we many not have
                more success in the tasks of metaphysics, if we suppose
                that objects must conform to our knowledge... We should
                then be proceeding precisely on the lines of Copernicus'
                primary hypothesis. Failing of satisfactory progress
                in explaining the movements of the heavenly bodies
                on the supposition that they all revolved round
                the spectator, he tried whether he might not have
                better success if he made the spectator
                to revolve and the stars remain at rest. A similar
                experiment can be tried in metaphysics, as regards
                the *intuition* of objects."

        front: His revolutionary suggestion
        back: |
                Drop the assumption that our thoughts *conform to objects*.
                Drop representational theory of truth.

                We can't know whether our ideas correspond to an idea-less
                object. On the basis of concepts, we can know nothing outside
                our minds. All of this follows from:
                <ol type="1">
                <li> we are acquainted only with experienced ideas
                <li> objects exist independently of our experience
                <li> knowledge requires that we ascertain correspondence
                between ideas and objects
                </ol>

                What if objects only exist if related to a rational mind?

                Maybe objects of experience are constructions of rational mind,
                with no reality independent of construction. Rational minds
                have structure (e.g. causality), which they **imposed** on
                objects known by them.

                <li> A priori: known to be true without reference to experience
                (7+5=12)
                <li> A posteriori: appeal to experience needed to determine
                truth or falsity.

                bodies are extended." (The predicate "extended" is already

                If an analytical judgement is true, it is necessarily
                true. (Every father has a child.)
                <li> Synthetic: does more than explicate or analyze a concept.
                "Every event has a cause.", "Air has weight." Opposite of
                a synthetic judgement is always possible.

                What differs between "It seems the book is heavy"
                vs. "the book is heavy"?
        back: |
                Subjective vs. objective judgement.
                The difference is the *manner* in which the judgements
                are made, or their *form*.
                The distinguishing feature is that in (B),
                we are thinking of *substance* together with
                its *properties*. Those concepts are not derived
                from sensations.

                *Substance* and *object* are a priori concepts.

                just a jumble of randomness. We don't discover causality there.

                them. So, they are only applicable *to experience*. All

        back: |
                There is only 1 infinite substance (which exists in itself).
                This is "God of Nature". Individuals and our experience are
                just its modifications.

                Mind and body are not substances, but attributes under which
                the one substance can be conceived.

                For every natural body, there is an idea. The mind is the idea
                corresponding to a human body. Mind and body are identical,
                mental changes and bodily changes isomorphic.

                There is no free will, because everything is a necessary
                expression of the divine nature. Freedom is just the power to
                act from one's own nature. God is the only completely free
                being.

                We are *in bondage* of emotions (love, desire, hate). Emotions
                are *caused in us*. We move towards freedom by intellectual
                love of God, coming to see necessities of the world as God sees
                them. This knowledge is the source of power to act (rather than
                react), virtue and joy; thus we can approximate the blessed
                life of God.

                Distinction between noumena and phenomena.

                Every event can be both natural and free.
                Thinking that we can only be free or only deterministic
                is a presumptuous position of *absolute reality*.

                Every appearance has 2 aspects: it's something that
                appears in the world of our experience, it's something
                in itself.

                As appearance, a part of the world of nature,
                it's governed by nature's principles.
                In this aspect, every action is causally determined.

                But as a thing in itself, we can't even say
                it occurs in time!
                And the category of causality doesn't extend beyond
                the bounds of experience, so an act of will may even
                be *absolutely* free as in Descartes.

                Concept of "that than which nothing greater

                All alleged examples are taken from *judgements*,
                not from things and their existence. But necessity of
                judgements is not the same as absolute necessity of
                things. If we reject the absolutely necessary being, we
                reject the thing itself with all its predicates; so
                then there is no contradiction.

                (Rejecting 3 angles in a triangle is a contradiction.
                Rejecting the triangle altogether is not.)

                Counterargument: When atheists reject God, they *must*
                have a concept of it to reject it.

                Counter-counterargument:
                "Being" is obviously not a real predicate.
                It's not a concept of something that could be added
                to the concept of a thing. It's just the positing
                of a thing as existing in themselves.

                ("Being" / "existence" is not a predicate in the sense
                "being a triangle" is. To say that some concept has
                *being* means claiming that the concept *applies*
                to something.)

                than an attempt be made to derive it from examples.
                For every example of morality presented to me must
                itself first be judged according to principles of
                morality in order to see whether it is fit to serve
                as an original example, i.e., as a model.
                But in no way can it authoritatively furnish the
                concept of morality. Even the Holy One of the gospel
                must first be compared with our ideal of moral
