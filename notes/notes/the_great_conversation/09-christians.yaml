                Lawyer asks "Who is my neighbour?"
                <br><br>
                A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
                and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat
                him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
                Now by chance a priest was going down that road;
                and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.
                So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place
                and saw him, passed by on the other side.
                But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he
                was; and when he saw him, he had compassion,
                and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on
                oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast
                and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
                And the next day he took out two denarii and gave
                them to the innkeeper, saying: "Take care of him;
                and whatever more you spend, I will repay you
                when I come back". Which of these three, do you think,
                proved neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?
                <br><br>
                He said: "The one who showed mercy on him."
                <br><br>
                And Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."

                eternal life. For God sent the Son into the world, not
                to condemn the world, but that the world might be
                saved through him.
