                Author: "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his
                self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability
                to use one's understanding without guidance from
                another. This immaturity is self-imposed when its
                cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack
                of resolve and courage to use it without guidance
                from another. Sapere Aude! &laquo;Have courage
                to use your own understanding!&raquo; &mdash;
                that is the motto of enlightenment."

                His project
        back: |
                Explain human nature as Newton did for nonhumans: simply and
                comprehensively. Shares Enlightenment project of *debunking
                superstition* (including "enthusiasm" of religion, which is far
                from dead), unscientific philosophy. Convinced human nature is
                fundamental, other sciences have some relation to it.

                Author: "They are not properly a science; but arise
                rather from the fruitless efforts of human vanity,
                which would penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible
                to understanding, or from the craft of popular
                superstitions, which, being unable to defend themselves
                on fair ground, raise these entangling brambles to cover
                and protect their weakness. Chased from the open
                country, these robbers fly into the forest, and lie
                in wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of the
                mind, and overwhelm it with religious fears and
                prejudices.The stoutest antagonist, if he remit his watch
                a moment, is oppressed. And many, through cowardice
                and folly, open the gates to the enemies, and willingly
                receive them with reverence and submission, as their
                legal sovereigns.

                But is this sufficient reason, why philosophers should
                desist from such researches, and leave superstition
                still in possession of her retreat? Is it not proper
                to draw an opposite conclusion, and perceive the
                necessity of carrying the war into the most secret
                recesses of the enemy?"

                Descartes: rightly skeptical, but spiritual substance was just
                a hypothesis.

                Hobbes's idea of mechanical mind was also a hypothesis.

                We don't have insight into actual "essence" of human bodies
                or minds and can only proceed by experiment.

        front: Relation between impressions and ideas, when does it hold
        back: |
                All impressions correspond to ideas. Not all ideas correspond
                to impressions (unicorns).

                This *duplicity* holds for all *simple* ideas, but not all
                complex ideas (e.g., unicorns).

                Every *simple* idea corresponds to a *simple impression* that
                resembles it.

        front: What comes first - impressions or ideas?
        back: |
                Impressions. Simple ideas *depend causally* on simple
                impressions -- they are in fact *copies*.

        back: |
                Every meaningful term is associated with an idea.
                However, some terms have no clear ideas behind them!
                We think they mean something, but they actually don't!
                This happens frequently - try to trace any term
                to an impression. If we can, it's a meaningful word
                expressing an idea. If we can't, it's nonsense.

                We don't have to make any experiments or observations,
                we can see it to be false by thinking alone.

                "Sun won't rise tomorrow": depends on *facts*.
                Falsity cannot be *demonstrated*, we have to use
                experience.

                It is that principle alone, which renders our experience
                useful to us, and makes us expect, for the future,
                a similar train of events with those which have
                appeared in the past. Without the influence of custom,
                we should be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact,

        back: |
                The *self* should be a *simple idea*, so it must come from
                an impression.

                There's no one impression that makes the *self* - such
                impression would continue through all our life, like the self
                does, but no impression is that constant and invariable.

                We have *no such idea as the self*!
                It makes no sense to affirm or deny the idea.

                Author: "For my part, when I enter most intimately into
                what I call *myself*, I always stumble on some
                particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light
                or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never
                can catch *myself* at any time without a perception,
                and never can observe any thing without a perception.
                When my perceptions are remov'd for any time, as by
                a sound sleep; so long am I insensible of *myself*,
                and may truly be said not to exist. And were all my
                poerceptions remov'd by death and cou'd I neither
                think, nor feel, nor see, nor love, nor hate after
                the dissolution of my body, I shou'd be entirely
                annihilated, nor do I conceive what is farther
                requisite to make me a perfect non-entity.
                If any one upon serious and unprejudic'd reflexion,
                thinks he has a different notion of *himself*, I must
                confess I can reason no longer with him. All I can
                allow him is, that he may be in the right as well
                as I, and that we are essentially different in this
                particular. He may, perhaps, perceive something simple
                and continu'd, which he calls *himself*; tho' I am

                From that, we suppose there is difference between effects from

                <li> Such an idea requires a cause.
                <li> Cause must be equal in "formal" reality to "subjective"
                reality of the idea.
                <li> I myself can't possibly be the cause.
                <li> So, God exists.
                </ol>

                Attacks (3): Idea of God is from impressions - reflections on
                our mind's operation (intelligence, wisdom, goodness).

                <li> You can't think of God without thinking he exists.
                <li> You think of God.
                <li> So you think God exists.
                <li> So God exists.
                </ol>

                Attack: (1) is about *relation of ideas*, not about *facts*.
                Maybe I can't think about God without thinking he exists, but
                that doesn't say anything about whether he *really does*.
                (3 &rarr; 4) is illegitimate.

                Argument from design (universe is a complex machine).

                It's *a posteriori* &mdash; needs knowledge of world being
                orderly.

                It's just *probabilistic* &mdash; as any argument from
                experience.

                *Doesn't show a perfectly good God* &mdash; world isn't
                perfect. (Principle of proportionality -- we'd be deriving more
                than argument gives us)
                Other options: many gods (makers); mortal Gods; evil makers;

                Author: "In every system of morality, which I have
                hitherto met with, I have always remark'd, that the
                author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of
                reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or
                makes observations about human affairs; when of
                a sudden I am surpriz'd to find, that instead of
                the usual copulations of propositions, *is*, and
                *is not*, I meet with no proposition that is not
                connected with an *ought*, or *ought not*. This change
                is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last
                consequence. For as this *ought* or *ought not*,
                expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis
                necessary that it shou'd be observ'd and explain'd;
                and at the same time that a reason should be given,
                for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this
                new relation can be a deduction from others,
                which are entirely different from it. But as authors
                do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume
                to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that
                this small attention wou'd subvert all the vulgar
                [i.e., common] systems of morality, and let us see,
                that the distinction of vice and virtue is not
                founded merely on the relations of objects,
                nor is perceiv'd by reason."
