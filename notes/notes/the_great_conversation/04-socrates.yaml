                His pupil Plato left many dialogues written after his
                death.
                He may have been putting his thought into Socrates's
                mouth.

                <ul>
                <li>
                <i>Early</i>: Accurate on Socrates' own views.
                Questions people on piety, courage, justice, arete.
                Usually no agreed conclusion.
                Participant claims answers, later admits ignorance.
                <li>
                <i>Middle</i>: Socrates still main character, many positive
                doctrines supported by arguments. Plato works
                out his solutions to problems of Sophists,
                goes beyond negative answers to Socratic questioning.
                <li>
                <i>Late</i>: Explores difficulties found in middle
                dialogues. Socrates plays lesser role, disappears in Laws.

                She was a midwife. Midwives determined
                if children were basterds (by resemblance
                to purported father). He helps deliver
                ideas and determine their truth by examining them.

                Alcibiades's reputation
        back: |
                First young and brilliant. Later notorious for lechery, lust
                for power. Suspected of mutilation of Hermes statues (often by
                gates of Athenian houses), put on trial while away on military
                assignment. Eventually deserted, served as Spartan general.

        front: How did Socrates make a living?
        back: |
                Frugal, temperate, not independently wealthy.
                Refrained from physical relationships (between
                older men and their young proteges).
                Believed friendships were properly aimed to make
                the "beloved" more virtuous, self-controlled and just.

                4 points of difference: Socrates vs. Sophists
        back: |
                <ul>
                <li>
                <i>No claim on knowing arete</i>:
                Sophists claim to teach it. Doesn't claim to know what it
                is. Tried to clarify whether it can be taught, whether it's one
                thing or many, etc.
                <li>
                <i>Not interested in natural philosophy</i>:
                Sophists teach it. Dabbled in it, but gave it up, it didn't
                intrigue him. Interested in i.e., "why are we here?"
                <li>
                Claimed he <i>never taught anybody anything</i>.
                <li>
                <i>Didn't take pay</i>, highest reward was gain of good
                friends.

                <li><i>Sophists</i>: win
                <li><i>Socrates</i>: advance toward the truth. Convinced there
                is a truth and we can make our opinions more like it. Neither
                a relativist nor a skeptic.

        back: |
                Everyone must say what they really believe,
                and not hang on to beliefs "no matter what".
                Both must aim for truth, not victory over other speaker.

        front: What kind of a person must you be to enjoy Socrates?
        back: |
                One who must be as happy to be shown wrong
                as to show someone else to be wrong.
                Or - even happier &mdash; because false opinions are evils.

                <ul>
                <li> We ought to search for truth.
                <li> Human excellence is knowledge.
                <li> All wrongdoing is due to ignorance.
                <li> The most important thing is to care for your soul.

                Soul knows the truth before it enters a human body.

        topic: Socrates
        front: On relativism
        back: |
                Socrates believes relativism makes us worse persons,
                less brave and lazier. "It's true for me" leads
                to intellectual idleness and cowardice.

        front: Why is self-knowledge essential?
        back: |
                From the soul flow all actions that reveal what we
                really are.
                <br>
                We need to know what we do know and what we do not so
                that we can act wisely. Foolishness is based on false
                opinions.
