        back: |
                Anaximander předpokládá balanci, která musí být
                navrácena, ať převážil kterýkoli element.
                Je to extenze Homerova vidění (který vykresloval balanci
                emocí - hněv, pýcha vedou k boží odplatě).
                Tento princip podle Anaximandra platí i všude ve světě,
                nejen mezi lidmi.
                Tento princip taky není od bohů, ale od světa samotného.
                Takhle podle Anaximandra svět prostě funguje - to je
                odpojení od Homéra (s Thaletem).

                <br><br>
                To think at all is to think that something *is*.
                It's impossible to think of "nothing".
                It is necessary to speak/think what is;
                for being is, but nothing is not.
                <br><br>
                Hence, nothing comes into being or comes to pass,
                because it would mean thinking of "nothing".
                Change is impossible, as is Heracleitan flux.

                Heraclitus: to be and not to be is the same (i.e., "to be clean").

                appearance and reality?
        back: |
                It appears that what is changes and that things come to
                be and come to pass, but that's not really the case.

        back: |
                Parmenides holds that the One is unchanging, etc.;
                Zeno supports it by showing that common sense
                (e.g., motion) is inconsistent.
                Zeno was Parmenides's pupil.

                Where does it move?
                If it moves where it is, there's no space left to
                move into.
                If it moves somewhere it's not, it's not there, so
                it's impossible.

                Democritus leaves no room for intelligent direction.
                What exists are atoms and void.
                There is *not further reason*, purpose or intention
                behind it.
                Nothing occurs at random, everything occurs for a
                reason and by necessity.
