                        Anaximander předpokládá balanci, která musí být navrácena,
                        ať převážil kterýkoli element.
                        Je to extenze Homerova vidění (který vykresloval balanci
                        emocí - hněv, pýcha vedou k boží odplatě).
                        Tento princip podle Anaximandra platí i všude ve světě,
                        nejen mezi lidmi.
                        Tento princip taky není od bohů, ale od světa samotného.
                        Takhle podle Anaximandra svět prostě funguje - to je
                        odpojení od Homéra (s Thaletem).

                        To think at all, he says, is to think that something *is*. Thought and being are the same.
                        Thinking and being are inseparable.
                        It is necessary to speak and to think what is; for being is, but nothing is not.
                        It's impossible to think of "nothing".

                        Soul is from very fine, spherical atoms, interpenetrating the whole body.
                        Their movement sets the body in motion.
