                        obzvlášť hezkou dívku.
                        Pohádali se, Achilles se vrátil do stanu a odmítal dál
                        bojovat.

                        Anaximander předpokládá balanci, která musí být
                        navrácena, ať převážil kterýkoli element.
                        Je to extenze Homerova vidění (který vykresloval balanci
                        emocí - hněv, pýcha vedou k boží odplatě).
                        Tento princip podle Anaximandra platí i všude ve světě,
                        nejen mezi lidmi.
                        Tento princip taky není od bohů, ale od světa samotného.
                        Takhle podle Anaximandra svět prostě funguje - to je
                        odpojení od Homéra (s Thaletem).

                        Sees all over, thinks all over, hears all over.
                        Remains in one place.
                        Without toil, he sets all things in motion by
                        the thought of his mind.

                        To think at all is to think that something *is*.
                        It's impossible to think of "nothing".

                        the he wouldn't pay until he won his first case.
                        He didn't enter any cases for some time.
                        Protagoras eventually brought him to court, prosecuting
                        him for payment.
                        <br>
                        The student argued:
                        <br>
                        If I win, I shall not have to pay (according to the
                        judgement of the court). If I lose, I will not have
                        won my first case, so I will not have to pay.
                        So I don't have to pay.
                        <br>
                        Protagoras:
                        <br>
                        If he loses this case, then by the judgement he will
                        have to pay me. If he wins it, he will have won his
                        first case and therefore he will have to pay me.
                        So he has to pay.

                        out his solutions to problems of Sophists,

                        He is convinced there is a truth

                        Cocks were sacrificed by sick people sleeping in Asclepius's temples,
                        hoping for a cure. "Death is a cure for the ills of life."

                        <br>
                        The source of unhappiness is a lack of harmony in
                        soul. Reason makes the decisions, supported by spirit,
                        desire is channeled appropriately.
                        <br><br>
                        Justice happens when people are in harmony.
                        Soul is happy when it is in harmony, hence "just".
                        We have *social justice* and *internal personal justice*.
                        Plato needs to show that *social justice* is good
                        for the individual.
                        *Internal justice*, it has been shown, is good for itself.
                        <br>
                        To be unjust is to allow the "internal beast" to rule
                        and overwhelm "the man within".
                        To be good is to be just,
                        so the Form of Justice takes us to the Form of the Good.

                        and that's not the case with anything that comes to be
                        by chance.

                        completes nature or "imitates nature". There is purpose
                        in art, so there must be purpose in nature as well.

                              never defines this. Just a "poetic metaphor".

                             If Forms are individual substances, it makes no
                             sense to think of them as shared among substances.
                             If they are universal (non-individual), there is
                             no sense in thinking of them as things existing

                             realized in a Form, but only in *each individual man*.
                             Forms just add "self" to sensible terms.

                        Most natural function of living beings is reproduction,
                        so they may share in eternity and divinity.<br><br>
                        This is what they all desire and purpose of all their
                        activity.<br><br>
                        What persists cannot be numerically the same (because
                        it's not possible to participate
                        both in eternity and divinity), so the species
                        reproduces.

                        2 answers to whether souls exist independently on
                        bodies
                back: >
                        Soul doesn't feel pity, learns or thinks - a man does.
                        Sometimes those penetrate to soul.
                        <br>
                        Sensation starts from particular objects;
                        recollection starts from the soul.
                        Sensation cannot occur without a body. Recollections
                        have bodily effects (e.g., running to catch a bus).
                        A person is *one being* with *one essence*.
                        <br><br>
                        Soul is a *substance*, inasmuch as it is the form of
                        a natural body that potentially possesses life.
                        A soul is a form for a *primary substance*.
                        If the eye were an animal, its soul would be sight.
                        <br><br>

                         <li> <i>Not an emotion</i>: (1) we are blamed not
                         for being angry but for giving in to it,
                         (2) we feel fear and anger without choice,
                         but virtues are a kind of choice (or aren't possible
                         without choice). We can't be good *naturally*.
                         <li> <i>Not innate</i>: through we have a capacity
                         for them, but learned by practicing
                         until they become habitual. *Can be taught.*
                         <li> <i>Many virtues</i> (contrast Plato, Socrates);
                         they are possibly independent. Often,
                         brave men are not moderate. In perfection, you
                         can't have one virtue without having all.

                        Ensure you don't develop just

                        Use of reason is *practical sense* or *practical
                        wisdom*.

                        On the mean - of emotions, etc. We should have
                        *right* amount of fear, for example - not too much

                        Right amount depends on *circumstances*

                        may not be courageous for another.
                        This is an *objective* relativity.
                        <br><br>
                        Role of reason is *finding this mean*, the right amount.
                        That is *practical sense* or *practical wisdom*.

                        A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
                        and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat
                        him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
                        Now by chance a priest was going down that road;
                        and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.
                        So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place
                        and saw him, passed by on the other side.
                        But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he
                        was; and when he saw him, he had compassion,
                        and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on
                        oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast
                        and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
                        And the next day he took out two denarii and gave
                        them to the innkeeper, saying: "Take care of him;
                        and whatever more you spend, I will repay you
                        when I come back". Which of these three, do you think,
                        proved neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?
                        <br><br>
                        He said: "The one who showed mercy on him."

                        We can be deceived by senses and make intellectual
                        mistakes.
                        But, we can know some things:
                        <br><br>
                        We exist, we know we exist, we know we're glad for it.

                        We are certain of: existence, life and knowledge
                        (or, alternatively, existence, knowledge and will).
                        Truth is available to us, at least a little bit -
                        about our inner life.
                        <br><br>
                        We also know mathematical truths. This knowledge
                        is common to us all.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, we have other practical truths we
                        agree on: "Incorrupt is better than corrupt.
                        Eternal is better than temporal. Inviolable
                        better than violable."
                        So the highest good must have this.

                        We can say "the pear should be more ripe".

                        We cannot recognize truth just by being told it,
                        words are at most *signs*. They represent some reality.
                        Some words signify other signs ("noun"),
                        some signify realities ("horse").
                        Knowledge may be expressed as signs, but not necessarily.
                        We do not learn from words - we must understand.
                        Words are at best reminders.
                        We don't consult a speaker, but the truth he has within.
                        Christ is who teaches, inside all of us. Every rational
                        minds consults him. Everyone receives as much as he
                        can because of his own good or bad will.
                        The inner light is like the light of the Sun.
                        God is, God is apprehended and God causes other
                        things to be apprehended.
                        Noone ever teaches another person anything.
                        For Augustine, we learn by contronting realities,
                        illuminated by the Interion Teacher: Christ.

                        Plotinus was familiar with mystical experience.
                        Multiplicity of things disappears.
                        Identity of the self with "the All", "the One",
                        "God"; untroubled bliss.
                        <br><br>
                        He talks about this reality as **the One**.
                        <br><br>
                        We can say nothing about *the One*, since
                        it would imply some multiplicity in it. It's "ineffable".
                        It's majesty *beyond being*. "Unity" / "the Transcendent"
                        / "the Good", "the Source".
                        <br><br>
                        The One is the source of whatever else exists.
                        It makes all things possible. Not a plurality,
                        but a source of plurality.
                        <br><br>
                        There are Many because the One is ungrudging in giving.
                        <br><br>
                        **Great Chain of Being**: reality partitioned
                        in graded steps, between the One and vanishingly
                        small realities.

                        Being is good, evil is lack of being.
                        Since Parmenides, what *is not* does not exist.
                        The good things are reality.
                        <br><br>
                        Because things lack some qualities doesn't make them
                        evil.
                        By necessity, not everything can be perfect
                        (like God is).
                        <br><br>
                        Evil can exist only where there is good. Nothing
                        is evil per se.

                        <br><br>
                        Manichees target time as an irrational element
                        in creation (good and evil are both eternal).
                        <br><br>
                        What was God before he created the world?
                        Why did he make it at some particular time?
                        <br><br>
                        God is not located in time at all.
                        <br><br>
                        The present is only an infinitesimal instant.
                        When time is present, it has no duration -
                        the knife edge between *what is not yet* and
                        *what is no longer*.
                        <br><br>
                        If we speak accurately, memory is *present of things
                        past*, direct awareness is *present of things
                        present*, expectation is *present of things future*.
                        These times all exist in the mind.
                        <br><br>
                        Time has no meaning apart from the mind,
                        so it *must* have come into being along with creation.
                        Minds are not eternal. In posession expectation,
                        attention and memory, minds are where time realizes
                        itself. As such, they are a faint image of God,
                        who also sees past, present and future.
                        God, unlike us, lives in a "never-ending present" -
                        he knows all time at once.

                        Will commits sin when it turns away from
                        immutable and common goods towards its private good.
                        Thus man becomes proud, meddlesome and lustful.

                        Pride is the root of sin.
                        "God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will
                        be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good
                        and evil." They wanted to be "like God".
                        <br><br>
                        The original sin: man regards himself as his own
                        light, and turns away from that light which would
                        make man himself a light if he would
                        set his heart on it.
                        <br><br>
                        There is no efficient cause of an evil choice.
                        It's not a matter of efficiency, but of deficiency.
                        <br>
                        If there were a cause for evil, it would - since it
                        is - be good. The cause for sin is that incomplete
                        being of the will is a *necessary condition* for sin.
                        If sin had an efficient cause, it would not
                        be subject to punishment.

                        No, there's no conflict between God's omniscience

                        Diminuition of being of humans;
                        divided will; with one part, we continue to
                        acknowledge the truth of God and righteousness of law,
                        with another we love something lesser.
                        <br><br>
                        By the evil use of free choice man has destroyed
                        both himself and it. When sin is committed by free
                        choice, sin becomes victor and free choice is lost.
                        <br><br>
                        If we have trust, faith, that God has forgiven and
                        received us, despite our turning away, we will be
                        healed.

                        Pelagius: since perfection is demanded from us,
                        it must be possible for us by our will.
                        <br><br>
                        We can never free ourselves from dependence upon God.
                        Free will is a gift, one of God's creations.
                        <br><br>
                        If we use our wills to turn to God, he doesn't owe
                        me a reward (because that would be repugnant).
                        We actually owe him greatest thanks. But then, did
                        *we* turn to God, or did he do it for us?
                        <br><br>
                        *Faith* (turning of our loves to God) is in our
                        power, but whether it will be exercised depends
                        on the presence of "inducements/invitations".
                        Choosing those is our act of free will.
