                        Anaximander předpokládá balanci, která musí být navrácena,
                        ať převážil kterýkoli element.
                        Je to extenze Homerova vidění (který vykresloval balanci
                        emocí - hněv, pýcha vedou k boží odplatě).
                        Tento princip podle Anaximandra platí i všude ve světě,
                        nejen mezi lidmi.
                        Tento princip taky není od bohů, ale od světa samotného.
                        Takhle podle Anaximandra svět prostě funguje - to je
                        odpojení od Homéra (s Thaletem).

                        Pythagoras first called himself a philosopher, a lover of wisdom.
                        According to him, noone is wise but the god.

                        To think at all, he says, is to think that something *is*. Thought and being are the same.

                        Democritus's principle leaves no room for intelligent direction to things.
                        What exists are atoms and void.
                        There is *not further reason*, n purpose or intention behind it.
                        Nothing occurs at random, but everything occurs for a reason and by necessity.

                        Citizenship was broadened, through not to women and slaves,
                        and citizens controlled major decisions.
                        This ensued for the next ~100 years, and (with some exceptions) some time after that.

                        The young man was poor and agreed with Protagoras
                        the he wouldn't pay until he won his first case.
                        He didn't enter any cases for some time.
                        Protagoras eventually brought him to court, prosecuting
                        him for payment.
                        <br>
                        The student argued:
                        <br>
                        If I win, I shall not have to pay (according to the
                        judgement of the court). If I lose, I will not have
                        won my first case, so I will not have to pay.
                        So I don't have to pay.
                        <br>
                        Protagoras:
                        <br>
                        If he loses this case, then by the judgement he will
                        have to pay me. If he wins it, he will have won his
                        first case and therefore he will have to pay me.
                        So he has to pay.

                        Quite accurate on Socrates' own views.
                        He questions people about piety, courage, justice
                        or arete. Usually no agreed-upon conclusion.

                        Socrates still the main character, many positive
                        doctrines supported by arguments. Plato is working
                        out his own solutions to the problems of Sophists,
                        goes beyond negative answers to Socratic questioning.
                        <li>
                        *Late*: Explore difficulties discovered in the middle
                        dialogues. Socrates plays a lesser role. In Laws,
                        he disappears altogether.

                        He tried to clarify it: whether it can be taught, whether it's one thing or many, etc.
                        <br><br>
                        Socrates also dabbled in natural philosophy (which
                        Sophists teach), but he gave it up, since it didn't
                        intrigue him.
                        He was interested in i.e., "why are we here?"

                        He claimed he never taught anybody anything.

                        They talk on piety - Socrates wants a definition

                        This man among you, mortals, is wisest who, like Socrates, understands that his wisdom is worthless.

                        Gyres was a shepard in service of the ruler of Lydia.
                        <br><br>
                        During a storm, an earthquake broke open the ground
                        and created a chasm where he was tending his sheep.
                        <br><br>
                        Inside, he found (among other things) a hollow bronze
                        horse, and inside, a corpse wearing just a golden ring.
                        <br><br>
                        On a regular meeting with the king on the state

                        and found that it makes him visible and invisible.
                        <br><br>
                        He arranged to become one of the messengers sent to
                        the king, and he seduced his wife, attacked him

                        Imagine a wholly unjust man who is known as just,
                        an a wholly just man who is known as unjust.
                        <br><br>
                        Plato will show that the just man is happier.
                        <br><br>
                        Men are happy when their soul is in excellent shape --
                        all 3 parts function properly.
                        <br>
                        The source of unhappiness is a lack of harmony in the soul.
                        Reason makes the decisions, supported by spirit, and
                        desire is channeled in appropriate directions.
                        <br><br>
                        Justice happens when people are in harmony.
                        The soul is happy when it is in harmony,
                        hence "just".
                        We have *social justice* and *internal personal justice*.
                        Plato needs to show that *social justice* is good
                        for the individual.
                        *Internal justice*, it has been shown, is good for itself.
                        <br>
                        To be unjust is to allow the "internal beast" to rule
                        and overwhelm "the man within".
                        To be good is to be just,
                        so the Form of Justice takes us to the Form of the Good.

                        Where democracy rules, rhetoric and persuasion carry

                        Statements are made from terms. Terms are not true or false on their own. Sentences are.
