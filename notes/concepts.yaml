                approximately twice as fast as I do. Of these two jobs,
                I’m ‘least bad’ at cleaning the house, so it might be

                If you get an extreme result (in a normal distribution)

                supplement x is amazingly better than all others,
                you shouldn’t put all your faith in that result.

                about the event, which makes it seem more important
                than it really is in everyday happiness, and 2)
                we underestimate our ability to adapt.

                When proposal to change a parameter is
                thought to have bad overall consequences, consider a
                change in the opposite direction. If this is also
                thought to have bad overall consequences, then the onus
                is on those who reach these conclusions to explain why
                our position cannot be improved through changes to this
                parameter. If they are unable to do so, then we have
                reason to suspect that they suffer from
                status quo bias.
