                front: Principal-agent problem
                back:
                        AKA agency dilemma. Occurs when one person/entity ("agent") is
                        able to make decisions on behalf of "principal". Exists when
                        agent is motivated to act in his own interests, which are
                        contrary to those of the principal. Example of moral hazard.
