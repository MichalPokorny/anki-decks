                        agent is motivated to act in his own interests, which are
                        contrary to those of the principal. Example of moral hazard.

                        I’m ‘least bad’ at cleaning the house, so it might be

                        Substituting a hard and important problem for an easy
                        and inconsequential one. When designing a nuclear plant,
                        Parkinson observed that the committee dedicated
                        a disproportionate amount of time to designing the
                        bikeshed. These are the kind of questions that everyone
                        is clever enough to contribute to, and where everyone
                        likely wants to have their opinions heard. Unfortunately,
                        these might be discussed at the cost of some of crucial
                        detail, like how to prevent the power plant from killing
                        everyone.

                        Moral judgements are made predominantly on the basis of intuition, which is followed by rationalisation. For example, slavery was previously a social norm and thought to be acceptable. When asked a question (“is slavery good?”), proponents of slavery introspected an answer (“yes”), and confabulated a reason (“because they’re not actually human” or similar atrocious falsehoods).

                        The most sexually selective sex will be that which has the most costs from rearing the offspring. In humans, women have more costs associated with raising offspring (maternal mortality, breastfeeding, rearing) and are the more selective sex. In seahorses, the opposite is true: male seahorses carry the offspring in their pouch, and are more selective with those they choose to mate with.

If this is also thought to have bad overall consequences, then the onus is on those who reach these conclusions to explain why our position cannot be improved through changes to this parameter. If they are unable to do so, then we have reason to suspect that they suffer from status quo bias.
