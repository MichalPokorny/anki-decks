                back: >
                        "No words for emotions". The distinguishing factor was their
                        inability to elaborate beyond a few limited adjectives such
                        as "happy" or "unhappy" when describing their feelings.
                        The core issue is that alexithymics have poorly differentiated
                        emotions limiting their ability to distinguish and describe
                        them to others. This contributes to the sense of emotional
                        detachment from themselves and difficulty connecting with
                        others, making alexithymia negatively associated with life
                        satisfaction even when depression and other confounding factors
                        are controlled for.

                front: Repetition compulsion
                back: >
                        Psychological phenomenon in which a person repeats a traumatic event or its circumstances over and over again.
                        This includes reenacting the event or putting oneself in situations where the event is likely to happen again.
                        This "re-living" can also take the form of dreams in which memories and feelings of what happened are repeated,
                        and even hallucination.

                        The term can also be used to cover the repetition of behaviour or life patterns more broadly: a "key component in
                        Freud's understanding of mental life, 'XYZZYFOO'...describes the pattern whereby people endlessly repeat patterns
                        of behaviour which were difficult or distressing in earlier life."
