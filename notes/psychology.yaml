                front: Alexithymia
                back: >
                        "No words for emotions". The distinguishing factor was their
                        inability to elaborate beyond a few limited adjectives such
                        as "happy" or "unhappy" when describing their feelings.
                        The core issue is that alexithymics have poorly differentiated
                        emotions limiting their ability to distinguish and describe
                        them to others. This contributes to the sense of emotional
                        detachment from themselves and difficulty connecting with
                        others, making alexithymia negatively associated with life
                        satisfaction even when depression and other confounding factors
                        are controlled for.
