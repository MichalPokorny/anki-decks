        front: Alexithymia
        back: |
                "No words for emotions". Inability to elaborate beyond
                a few limited adjectives such as "happy" or "unhappy"
                when describing feelings. The core issue is that
                alexithymics have poorly differentiated emotions
                limiting their ability to distinguish and describe
                them to others. This contributes to the sense of
                emotional detachment from themselves and difficulty
                connecting with others, making alexithymia negatively
                associated with life satisfaction even when depression
                and other confounding factors are controlled for.

                relationships, no point in sharing time with others.

        front: Repetition compulsion
        back: |
                Psychological phenomenon in which a person repeats a
                traumatic event or its circumstances over and over
                again. This includes reenacting the event or putting
                oneself in situations where the event is likely to
                happen again. This "re-living" can also take the form
                of dreams in which memories and feelings of what
                happened are repeated, and even hallucination.

                The term can also be used to cover the repetition of
                behaviour or life patterns more broadly: a "key component in
                Freud's understanding of mental life, 'XYZZYFOO'...describes the pattern whereby people endlessly repeat patterns
                of behaviour which were difficult or distressing in earlier life."
