        front: BBP-type formula
        back:
                Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula. Computes n-th binary digit of pi using base 16 math.
                Can directly calculate some digit of pi without calculating preceding digits.
                Since this discovery, many formulas for other irrational constants have been discovered of the general form.
                Formulas in this form are known as BBP-type formulas.
                $$\pi = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}\left[ \frac{1}{16^k} \left( \frac{4}{8k + 1} - \frac{2}{8k + 4} - \frac{1}{8k + 5} - \frac{1}{8k + 6} \right) \right]$$

                agent is motivated to act in his own interests, which are
                contrary to those of the principal. Example of moral hazard.

        front: Alexithymia
        back:
                "No words for emotions". The distinguishing factor was their
                inability to elaborate beyond a few limited adjectives such
                as "happy" or "unhappy" when describing their feelings.[23]
                The core issue is that alexithymics have poorly differentiated
                emotions limiting their ability to distinguish and describe
                them to others.[4] This contributes to the sense of emotional
                detachment from themselves and difficulty connecting with
                others, making alexithymia negatively associated with life
                satisfaction even when depression and other confounding factors
                are controlled for.[24]
